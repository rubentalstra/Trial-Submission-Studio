The ADaMIG specifies ADaM standard dataset structures and variables, including nam ing conventions. It also specifies standard solutions to implementation issues. The ADaMIG must be used in close concert with the current version of the document titled \"Analysis Data Model (ADaM)\" (available at ht tp://www.cdisc.org/adam ). That document explains the purpose of the Analysis Data Model. It describes fundamental principles that apply to all analysis datasets, with the driving principle being that the design of ADaM datasets and associated metadata faci litate explicit communication of the content of, input to, and purpose of submitted ADaM datasets. The Analysis Data Model supports efficient generation, replication, and review of analysis results. Note that in the remainder of the ADaMIG, the document ti tled \"Analysis Data Model (ADaM)\" is referred to as the ADaM Model document.",

The SDTM and ADaM standards were designed to support submission to a regulatory agency such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since inception, the CDISC ADaM Team has been encouraged and informed by FDA statistical and medical reviewers who participate in ADaM meetings as observers, and who have participated in CDISC - FDA pilots. The origin of the fundamental principles of ADaM was the need for transparency of communication with and scientifically valid review by regulatory agencies. The ADaM standard has been developed to meet the needs of the FDA and industry. ADaM is applicable to a wide range of drug development activities in addition to FDA regulatory submissions. It provides a standard for tr ansferring datasets between sponsors and contract research organizations (CROs), development partners, and independent data monitoring committees. ADaM supports efficient data sharing among pharmaceutical sponsors, CROs, and any partners involved in in - lic ensing, out - licensing, or mergers. In addition, readers of the ADaMIG should be aware of information provided by the FDA. Specifically, the FDA website has a central location for the posting of FDA regulations and guidance documents that relate to data sta ndards. The main page, \"Study Data Standards Resources\" ( http://www.fda.gov/forindustry/datastandards/ ), contains links to important documents, both published and d raft, for Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). One such document is the Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (FDA sdTCG; see https://www.fda.gov/media/88173/download ). Readers should also be aware that other TCGs exist for other regulatory agencies, such as the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA; https://www.pmda.go.jp/english/ ) TCG for Japan submissions.",

Note that this ADaM requirement is also discussed in the FDA sdTCG. A BDS dataset contains 1 or more records per subject, per analysis parameter, per analysis time point. Analysis timepoint is not required; it is dependent on the analysis. In situations where there is no analysis timepoint, the structure is 1 or more records per subject per analysis parameter.

Although the BDS supports most statistical analyses, it does not support all statistical analyses. For example, it does not support simultaneous analysis of multiple dependent (response/outcome) variables or a correlatio n analysis across a range of response variables. The BDS was not designed to support analysis of incidence of adverse events or other occurrence data. Analysis of such data is supported in the OCCDS.

Examples: a hypertension category column added to the ADaM dataset to enable subgroup analysis, an age covariate added to enable the analysis to be ag e- adjusted, a center stratification factor in a multicenter study. Record – A row in a dataset. A record is also referred to as an \"observation\" within this document. Scope – The extent or range within which an ADaMIG requirement applies (e.g., within a st udy, within a dataset, within a parameter, or within a specified subset of rows within a parameter). For example, AVALCATy is a categorization of AVAL or AVALC within a parameter. In this example, \"within a parameter\" is the scope of the statement, \"AVALCA Ty is a categorization of AVAL\". Throughout the ADaMIG, scope is often conveyed in sentences containing the text \"within a ...\".

Note that the ADaM analysis parameter contains all of the information needed to identify uniquely a group of related analys is values. In contrast, the SDTM -- TEST column may need to be combined with qualifier columns such as -- STRESU, -- POS, -- LOC, -- SPEC, in order to identify a group of related values. In this document the word \"parameter\" is used as a synonym for \"analysis p arameter.\" Example: The primary efficacy analysis parameter is \"Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)\". Analysis timepoint – A row identifier used to classify values within an analysis parameter into temporal or conceptual groups used for analyses. These groupings may be observed, planned, or derived. Example: The primary efficacy analysis was performed at the Week 2, Week 6, and Endpoint analysis timepoints. Analysis value – (1) The numeric (AVAL) or character (AVALC) value described by the analysis parameter. The analysis value may be present in the input data, a categorization of an input data value, or derived. Example: The analysis value of the parameter \"Body Mass Index\" was derived in an ADaM dataset from collected height and collected weight. (2) In addition, values of certain functions are considered to be analysis values. Examples: baseline value (BASE), change from baseline (CHG). Parameter - variant – A column that is derived as a function of AVAL (or AVALC) is parameter - variant if it is calculated differently for some parameters for which the variable is populated in a dataset. Thus, a column is parameter - variant if how it is derived depends on which parameter is on the row. For example, AVALCATy categorizes AVAL (or AVALC). The categories may diff er depending on the parameter, which makes AVALCATy parameter - variant. Parameter - invariant – A column that is derived as a function of AVAL (or AVALC) is parameter - invariant if it is calculated the same way for all parameters for which the variable is popu lated in a dataset. Thus, a column is parameter - invariant if how it is derived does not depend on which parameter is on the row. The parameter - invariant derivation remains the same across all parameters, although it may be left null for parameters where it does not apply. For example, the derivation for the change from baseline variable is CHG = AVAL - BASE, an equation that is the same for all parameters. CHG is therefore a parameter - invariant variable. The concept of parameter invariance is essential to the integrity of the BDS because it is an integral component in the rules defined in Section 4.2, Creation of Derived Columns Versus Creation of Derived Rows , that prohibit \"horizontalization\" (creation of new columns w hen the model dictates that a new row is required instead) by producers.",

It is good practice to start the names of non - ADaM analysis datasets with the two - letter prefix \"AX\" (see Figure 1.6.1).

The metadata must identify when and how analysis data have been derived or imputed. • ADaM datasets must be readily usable with commonly available software tools. • ADa M datasets must be associated with metadata to facilitate clear and unambiguous communication. Ideally the metadata are machine - readable. • ADaM datasets should have a structure and content that allow statistical analyses to be performed with minimal programming. Such datasets are described as \"analysis - ready.\" ADaM datasets contain the data needed for the review and re - creation of specific statistical analyses.

      "content": "2.2 Traceability To assist review, ADaM datas ets and metadata must clearly communicate how the ADaM datasets were created. A CDISC - conformant submission includes both SDTM and ADaM datasets; therefore, it follows that the relationship between SDTM and ADaM must be clear. To ensure traceability, all S DTM variables utilized for variable derivations in ADaM should be included in the ADaM datasets when practical. This requirement highlights the importance of traceability between the analyzed data (ADaM) and its input data (SDTM). Traceability is built by clearly establishing the path between an element and its immediate predecessor. As described in Section 1.5.1, General ADaM Definitions , the full path is traced by going from one element to its predecessors, the n on to their predecessors, and so on, back to the SDTM datasets, and ultimately to the data collection instrument. Note that the CDISC Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) standard is harmonized with SDTM and therefore assists in ens uring end - to - end traceability. Traceability establishes across - dataset relationships as well as within - dataset relationships. For example, the metadata for supportive variables within the ADaM dataset facilitates the understanding of how (and perhaps why) derived records were created. There are two levels of traceability: 1. Metadata traceability facilitates the understanding of the relationship of the analysis variable to its source dataset(s) and variable(s) and is required for ADaM compliance. This traceab ility is established by describing (via metadata) the algorithm used or steps taken to derive or populate an analysis variable from its immediate predecessor. Metadata traceability is also used to establish the relationship between an analysis result and A DaM dataset(s). 2. D atapoint traceability points directly to the specific predecessor record(s) and should be implemented if practical and feasible. This level of traceability can be very helpful when trying to trace a complex data manipulation path. This tra ceability is established by providing clear links in the data (e.g., by use of - - a -- SEQ variable) to the specific data values used as input for an analysis value. The BDS and OCCDS structures were designed to enable datapoint traceability back to predecessor data. I t may not always be practical or feasible to provide datapoint traceability via record identifier variables from the source dataset(s). However, metadata traceability must always clearly explain how an analysis variable was populated regardless of whether datapoint traceability is also provided.

In these situations, traceability may be accomplished by submitting those intermediate analysis datasets along with the ir associated metadata. Traceability would then involve several steps. The analysis results would be linked by appropriate metadata to the data which supports the analytical procedure, those data would be linked to the intermediate analysis data, and the i ntermediate data would in turn be linked to the source SDTM data. When traceability is successfully implemented, it is possible to identify: • Information in the ADaM datasets that comes from the SDTM data • Information that is derived or imputed within the AD aM dataset • The method used to create derived or imputed data • Information used for analyses, in contrast to information that is not used for analyses yet is included to support traceability or future analysis",

      "content": "2.3 The ADaM Data Structures A fundamental principle of ADaM datasets is clear communication. Given that ADaM datasets contain both source and derived data, a central issue becomes communicating how the variables and observations were derived and how observations are used to produce analysis results. The co nsumer of an ADaM dataset must be able to identify clearly the data inputs and the algorithms used to create the derived information. If this information is communicated in a predictable manner through the use of a standard data structure and metadata, the consumer of an ADaM dataset should be able to understand how to use the ADaM dataset to replicate results or to explore alternative analyses. Many types of statistical analyses do not require a specialized structure. In other words, the structure of an AD aM dataset does not necessarily limit the type of analysis that can be done, nor should it limit the communication about the dataset itself. Instead, if a predictable structure can be used for the majority of ADaM datasets, communication will be enhanced. A predictable structure has other advantages in addition to supporting clear communication. First, a predictable structure eases the burden of the management of dataset metadata because there is less variability in the types of observations and variables t hat are included. Second, software tools can be developed to support metadata management and data review, including tools to restructure the data (e.g., transposing) based on known key variables. Finally, a predictable structure allows an ADaM dataset to be checked for conformance with ADaM standards, using a set of known conventions that can be verified. As described in Section 1, Introduction , the ADaMIG describes 2 ADaM standard data structures: ADSL and BDS. Standard ADaM variables are described in Section 3, Standard ADaM Variables . Implementation issues, solutions, and examples are presented in S ection 4, Implementation Issues, Standard Solutions, and Examples .

Other ADSL variables may also be included for traceability or other reasons. A variable that is present in both ADSL and any other ADaM dataset must have the same values, type, and label. Note that the FDA sdTCG requests that \"core\" subject - level variables be present in all analysis datasets. For all regulatory submissions, refer to relevant regulatory agency requirements and discuss with the reviewing agency. Although it would be technically feasible to take every single data value in a study and include them all as variables in a subject - level dataset such as ADSL, that is neither the intent nor the purpose of the ADSL. The ADSL is used to provide key facts about the subject that are analysis - enabling o r which facilitate interpretation of analysis. The ADSL is not the correct location for key endpoints and data that vary over time during the course of a study.

Analysis timepoint is conditionally required, depending on the an alysis. In situations where there is no analysis timepoint, the structure is one or more records per subject per analysis parameter. As defined in Section 1.5.2, Basic Data Structure Definitions , analysis timepoint here represents 1 or more actual variables, such as Analysis Visit (AVISIT), Analysis Timepoint (ATPT), or other timing variables. In addition, other variables may be needed to describe more completely the structure of a given BDS dataset. For example, Baseline Type (BASETYPE) is needed when there is more than 1 definition of baseline for a given Analysis Parameter (PARAM) in the same dataset. This structure contains a central set of variables that represent the data being analyzed. These variables include the value being analyzed (e.g., AVAL) and the description of the value being analyzed (e.g., PARAM). Other variables in the dataset provide more information about the value being analyzed (e.g., the subject identification), describe and trace the derivatio n of it (e.g., DTYPE), or enable the analysis of it (e.g., treatment variables, covariates). It should be noted that although the ADSL is a source for subject - level variables used in BDS datasets, this does not mean that every ADSL variable should be inclu ded in the BDS dataset. Readers are cautioned that ADaM dataset structures do not have counterparts in SDTM. Because the BDS tends toward a vertical design, some might perceive it as similar to the SDTM Findings class. However, BDS datasets may be derived from Findings, Events, Interventions and Special - purpose SDTM domains, other ADaM datasets, or any combination thereof. Further, in contrast to SDTM Findings class datasets, BDS datasets provide robust and flexible support for the performance and review of most statistical analyses. A record in an ADaM dataset can represent an observed, derived, or imputed value required for analysis. For example, it may be a time to an event (e.g., the time to when a score became greater than a threshold value or the time to discontinuation) or it may be a highly derived quantity (e.g., a surrogate for tumor growth rate derived by fitting a regression model to laboratory data). A data value may be derived from any combination of SDTM and/or ADaM datasets. The BDS is flexibl e in that additional rows and columns can be added to support the analyses and provide traceability, according to the rules described in Section 4.2, Creation of Derived Columns Versus Creation of Derived Rows .

The ADaM standard requires that these variable names be used when a variable that contains the content defined in Section 3 is included in any ADaM dataset, regardless of datase t class. It also requires these ADaM standard variables be used for the purposes indicated, even if the content of an ADaM variable is a copy of the content of an SDTM dataset variable. Section 3 also defines standard naming fragments (with position within the variable name included as the part of the definition in some instances) to be used in creating new variable names. In the variable - name fragments presented later in this section, an asterisk (*) is used to indicate that 1 or more letters can be added to create a producer - specific variable name. If a fragment is defined for a specific concept (see Section 3.1.5, Variable Naming Fragments ), it is best practice that any variable related to the concept contain the defined fragment in its name. Specific fragments, described in Table 3.1.5.1 , are required to be used whenever the concept applies and are reserved to be used only for the corresponding concept. For example, the fragment \"DTF\" is defined as a suffix for date imputation flag variables; therefore, a variable that indicates the level of imputation must contain \"DTF\" as the last 3 characters in the variable name. In addition, Table 3.1.5.2 a nd Table 3.3.3.3 list fragments that can be used when naming variables in ADaM datasets. These lists of fragments are provided as a guide when naming variables in ADaM datasets. In addition, fragments defined in the SDTM and SDTMIG must be considered in order to avoid creating an ADaM variable with the same name as an SDTM dataset variable .

The lower - case letter \" w \" in a variable name (e.g., PH w SDT, P xx S w SDT) is an index for the w th variable where \" w \" is replaced with a single digit [1 – 9]. b. The letters \" xx \" in a variable name (e.g., TRT xx P, AP xx SDT) refer to a specific period where \" xx \" is replaced with a zero - padded 2 - digit integer [01 – 99]. The use of \" xx\" within a variable name is restricted to the concept of a period, and \" xx \" is not considered an index. c. The lower - case letter \" y \" in a variable name (e.g., SITEGR y ) refers to a grouping or other categorization scheme, an analysis criterion, or an analysis range, and is replaced with an integer [1 – 99, not zero - padded]. Truncation of the original variable name may be necessary in rare situations when a 2 - digit index is needed and causes the length of the variable name to exceed 8 characters. In these situations, it is recommended that the same truncation be used for both the character and numeric versions of the variables in a variable pair. d. The lower - case letters \" zz \" in a variable name (e.g., ANL zz FL) are an index for the zz th variable where \" zz \" is replaced with a zero - padded 2 - digit integer [01 - 99]. Note that the \" zz\" convention represents a simple counter, while the \"xx \" convention represents a specific period. e. If an indexed variable is included in a dataset, there is no requirement that the preceding variable(s) in the sequence be included. For example, a dataset might include ANL02FL but not ANL01FL. 3. Any variable in an ADaM dataset whose name is the same as an SDTM variable must be a copy of the SDTM variable, and its label, meaning, and values must not be modified. ADaM adheres to a principle of harmonization known as \"same name, same meaning, same values.\" However, to optimize file size, it is permissible that the length of the variables differ (e.g., trailing blanks may be removed). In many cases it makes sense to copy over a variable from an SDTM dataset. For example, the SDTM variable -- SEQ may be useful for traceability. However, in other cases, it is also perfectly acceptable, and mig ht be much better, to create an ADaM variable with a meaningful variable name and clear and unambiguous metadata. An SDTM variable may be somewhat meaningless when removed from its SDTM context.",

In any case, whenever values are modified in any way, it is mandatory to do so in an ADaM variable, and it is prohibited to do so in a variable whose name is that of an SDTM variable. 4. When an ADaM standard variable name has been defined for a specific concept, the ADaM standard variable name must be used, even if the content of an ADaM variable is a direct copy of the content of an SDTM variable. For example, in the creation of an ADaM dataset based on an SDTM LB dataset, even if AVAL is just a copy of LBSTRESN, the dataset must contain AVAL. 5. For variable pairs designated as having a one - to - one relationship within a specified scope (e.g., within a parameter, within a study), if both variables are present in the dataset and there exists a row in that scope on which both variables are populated, then there must be a one - to - one relationship between the two variables on all rows within the scope on which both variables are populated. The scope noted in this document should be considered the minimum level for the mapping; it does not preclude the producer from using a broader level of scope. For example, if a one - to - one relationship is specified as within a PARAM, the producer may elect to use the same one - to - one relationship across all PARAMs within the dataset or study. In addition, note that \"within a paramete r\" means \"within a parameter within a dataset.\" 6. In a pair of corresponding variables (e.g., TRTP and TRTPN), the primary or most commonly used variable does not have the suffix or extension (i.e., N for numeric or C for character). The relevant suffix is u sed only on the name of the secondary member of the variable pair. For example, in the (TRTP, TRTPN) pair, the primary variable, TRTP, is character, but it is not named TRTPC. Similarly in the (APERIOD, APERIODC) pair, the primary variable, APERIOD, is num eric, but it is not named APERIODN.

The variable fragments to be used for these variables are DTF and TMF, as defined in Table 3.1.5.1 . DF and TF can be used as abbreviated forms of DTF and TMF, respectively, when the use of DTF or TMF would create a variable name longer than 8 characters. These additional imputation flag variables are conditionally required. The root, identified by \"*\", of the names of each pair of variables, *DT and *DTF ( or *DF), should be identical. The same is true for the corresponding time and imputation flag variables *TM and *TMF (or *TF). Thus it is good practice to limit roots to 5 characters in length.

For a given SDTM DTC vari able, if only hours and minutes are ever collected, and seconds are imputed in *DTM as 00, then it is not necessary to set *TMF to \"S\". However if seconds are generally collected but are missing in a given value of the DTC variable and imputed as 00, or if a collected value of seconds is changed in the creation of *DTM, then *TMF should be set to \"S\". If a time was imputed *TMF must be populated and is required. Both *DTF and *TMF may be needed to describe the level of imputation in *DTM if imputation was d one.

For example, if in a given -- DTC variable in a dataset, dates are present on all records but time is missing on some records, then within any given date, the records with missing time may sort or compare before the records that contain a value of time. Thus the -- DTC variable would sort or compare in a manner that is equivalent to imputing midnight when time is missing. The sort or comparison may work mechanically, but imputing midnight may not be the most appropriate thing to do for statistical analysis. Further, the effective imputation of midnight would be hidden and not made explicit. It is important to consider the implications of implicit or explicit imputation whenever dates, times, or datetimes are compared or sorted.",

As indicated in Tables 3.3.4.3.1 and 3.3.8.1 , some common character flags use the scheme Y/null. The choice of Y/N/null vs Y/null is dependent on analysis needs. Y/N/null should be used when N and null values need to be analyzed differently. Y/null c an be used when the need is to analyze just the Y values. Corresponding 1/0/null and 1/null schemes apply to numeric flags with variable names that end in FN and which are not population indicators. 10.

For these fragments, it is a requirement that the appropriate fragment be used whenever the concept applies and that the fragment is reserved to be used only for the corresponding concept. For example, a variable whose name ends in DT must contain a numeric date, and a variable created to contain a numeric date must have a name ending in DT.

As described below, the position of this fragment within the variable name is dependent on the purpose of the variable. Note that in BDS datasets, there is only one baseline variable, BASE, and only one change from baseline variable, CHG. The BL and CHG fragments must not be used to create BDS variables containing alternative baselines and changes from baseline for AVAL. Additional definitions of baseline relevant to a given parameter must be accommodated by the addition of rows rather than addition of variables. See Section 3.3.4, Analysis Parameter Variables for BDS Datasets , and Section 4.2 .1.6 , Rule 6 . However, if the baseline or change from baseline of a different parameter is needed in the analysis of a given parameter, for example, as a covariate in an analysis of covariance, that analysis - enabling variable may be added and its name should contain the fragment BL or CHG. There are 2 main categories of variable names relative to timepoints: content at a particular timepoint (e.g., weight at baseline) and timepoint timing (e.g., screening date). Assembly of these types of variable names using timing fragments defined in Table 3.1.5.2 is as follows: Content at a timepoint: Because the timing of a variable qualifies the content of the variable, timing fragments are used as the variable name suffix. The complete variable naming convention is *( xx ) FF , where * represents the content of the variable (up to 4 characters) and FF r epresents the timing fragment. For any timing fragments that are repeated for multiple periods, the period number ( xx ) should be placed before the suffix. If period numbers are not needed, the variable will be of the form * FF , with * representing the conte nt of the variable (up to 6 characters) Timepoint timing: If timepoint variables are needed that would use these timing fragments, the timing fragments will become the prefix of the variable name. For dates, then, the structure of the variable name is FF ( xx )*, where * represents the date fragment (e.g., DT, SDT, EDTM, etc.; up to 4 characters) and FF represents the timing fragment. This scheme is consistent with ADSL timepoint variables such as RANDDT, TR01SDT.",

There are only 2 exceptions to this rule: 1. Descriptive text is allowed at the end of the labels of variables whose names contain indexes \" y \" or \" zz \"; and 2. Variable labels containing a word or phrase in curly brackets, e.g., {Time} (the labe l for *TM variables), should be replaced by the producer with appropriate text. The label must contain the bracketed word or phrase somewhere in the text. For example, *STM must use the phrase \"Start Time\" in the label, so labels such as \"Start Time of Rescue Med\" or \"Rescue Med Start Time\" are both valid. It is important to note that the standard variable labels by no means imply the use of standard derivation algorithms across studies and/or producers. It should be noted that when the CDISC Notes for a variable refer to another variable, it is understood that this means \"on the same record or row.\" For example, \"The numeric code for TRTP\" is understood to mean \"The numeric code for TRTP on the same record.\" Controlled Terminology has been developed for the values of certain ADaM variables. The most current CDISC terminology sets can be accessed via the CDISC website ( http://www.cdisc.org/terminology ). In the tables in this section, the parenthesized external codelist name appears in the Codelist/ Controlled Terms column, where relevant. Examples of controlled terms in this document should be considered examples only; the official source is the most current CDISC set available through the website. Note that CDISC Controlled Terminology sets cannot represent null (absence of a value) in the list of valid terms because \"null\" is not a term. However, unless specified in the definition for a specific variable, null is allowed. Additional variables not defined in thi s section, may be necessary (e.g., to enable analysis, to support traceability, to facilitate presentation of the data), and may therefore be added to ADaM datasets, providing that they adhere to the ADaM naming conventions and rules as defined in this doc ument.",

The structure of the ADSL is 1 record pe r subject, regardless of the type of clinical trial design. This section lists standard ADSL variables. Section 2.3.1, The ADaM Subject - Level Analysis Dataset (ADSL) , describes the content of the ADSL and addresses the kinds of variables that are and are not appropriate for inclusion in the ADSL.

For ADSL variables, the scope is \"within the study.\" For exam ple, the definition of SITEGR1 is consistent for all datasets within a study. It is acknowledged that the scope of USUBJID extends beyond the study, as defined in the SDTM. There may be situations where highly derived variables are to be included in the ADSL yet the derivation of these variables may better be performed in another ADaM dataset.

Additional timing variables can be included for phase, period, and subperiod (APHASE, APERIOD, and ASPER, defined in Table 3.3.3.1 ). Table 3.2.7 provides the subject - level variables for these timing elements. The following provisions apply to the inclusion or exclusion of sets of pairs of subject - level analysis timing variables in ADSL. A set of pairs of subject - level analysis timing variable is the set of start and end variables for an analysis timing element, su ch as phase, period, or subperiod. For example, for analysis period, the set consists of APxxSDT and APxxEDT for all of the analysis periods xx in the study. The set of timing variables for a sp ecific phase, period, or subperiod includes only those variabl es from Table 3.2.7 that are applicable to the study. For example, although the period start time is defined in Table 3.2.7, it should be included in the set of analysis period timing variables only if needed for the study. 1. A set of analysis timing variables can be included in ADSL only if the definitions for all of the variables in the set are fixed across the study (i.e., the definitions of the start and end of each timing element for a given subject do not change based on endpoint or data type). Th e firs t such set consists of all of the analysis period timing variables defined in Table 3.2.7. The second set consists of all of the subperiod timing variables in that table. The third set consists of all of the phase timing variables in that table. 2. If period timing variables are not included in ADSL, then subperiod timing variables must be excluded from ADSL. 3. If any of the definitions of the variables in the set do vary, for example, when analysis period start or stop date definitio ns differ for safety and ef ficacy analyses, then none of the variables in the set can be included in ADSL. 4. If all of the variable definitions in the set are the same across all datasets, then they can be included in ADSL.

Stratified randomization is used to ensure balance of treatment assignments across one or more prognostic factors. A \"prognos tic f actor\" is an aspect of the disease or a characteristic of the subject that may influence treatment response. The prognostic factors used to stratify the randomization are specified in the protocol. As a simple example, suppose age group (<50, >=50) and gen der (male, female) are considered important prognostic factors. When a subject is deemed eligible for randomization, their individual values of these factors are determined at the site and used as input to the rand omization process to determine their treat ment assignment. The situation may occur where the value of a factor used for randomization is later discovered to be in erro r. For example, suppose a subject was randomized according to the age group of <50 and male. Later, it was discovered that the subject was actually 54 and therefore should have been randomized according to the age group of >=50 and male. If this situation happens too often, the balance in treatment assignm ents across these factors is in question, which may then result in the use of se nsitivity analyses. Therefore, there is an analysis need to have two sets of values to describe the stratification factors. In this document, these two sets of values are referred to the “as randomized” values and the “as verified” values. The \"as verified \" values are derived using source documentation. At present, there is no standard method for representing the randomization strata factors and values in SDTM - based datasets.",

If using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS), the values used for randomization would be captured by the system and would correspond to the values that are represented on the randomization schedule.

A BDS dataset contains 1 or more records per subject, per analysis parameter, per analysis timepoint. An analysis timepoint is conditionally required, depending on the analysis. In situations where there is no analysis timepoint, the structure is 1 or more records per subject per analysis parameter. Typically there are several BDS datasets in a study. This section of the ADaMIG defines the s tandard variables used in BDS datasets. See Section 3.2, ADSL Variables , for ADSL variables, any of which may also be included in BDS datasets to support traceability or enable analysis. In this section, \"within a given study, subject, and dataset\" is implied, unless otherwise stated. For example, the description of ABLFL defin es it as a variable that indicates baseline record for each parameter, or, if there is more than 1 baseline definition, for each parameter and baselin e type (BASETYPE). It should be understood that the baseline record is for the subject identified by USUBJID. In addition, not e that \"within a parameter\" means \"within a parameter within a dataset.\"",

If a dataset contains more than 1 record within a parameter and within a subject, then an SDTM or ADaM relative timing variable must be present (eg, ADY, ASTDY, AENDY, AVISIT, ATPT). Table 3.3.3.1 defines analysis timi ng variables for BDS datasets. The timing variables whose names start with the letter A are the timing variables directly associated with the AVAL and AVALC variables in the ADaM dataset. Timing variables not directly characterizing AVAL (e.g., *DT) should be prefixed by a character string instead of the placeholder asterisk shown in Table 3.3.3.3, so that their actual names comply with the variable naming conventions described in Section 3.1, ADaM Variable Conventions . In many cases, the prefix for these date and time variables would match that of an SDTM -- DTC, -- STDTC or -- ENDTC variable name. For example, if a numeric date variable were created from -- STDTC, then it would be named -- SDT. However, if -- DTC or -- STDTC is the date that is associated with AVAL and AVALC, its numeric equivalent should be named ADT or ASTDT, as appropriate.

PARAM must include all descriptive and qualifying information relevant to the analysis purpose of the parameter. Some examples are: \"Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)\", \"Log10 (Weight (kg))\", \"Time to First Hypertension Event (Days)\", and \"Estimated Tumor Growth Rate\". PARAM should be sufficient to describe unambiguously the contents of AVAL and/or AVALC. Examples of qualifying information that might be relevant to analysis, and are therefore candidates for inclusion in PARAM, are units, specimen type, location, position, machine type, and transformation function. There is no need to include qualifiers that are not relevant to the analysis of PARAM. In contrast to SDTM -- TEST, no additional variable is needed to further qualify PARAM . PARAM is restricted to a maximum of 200 characters. If the value of PARAM will be used as a variable label in a transposed dataset, then the producer may wish to limit the value of PARAM to 40 characters. Such limitation to 40 characters should not comp romise the integrity of the description. PARAM is often directly usable in Clinical Study Report displays. Note that in the ADaMIG, \"parameter\" is a synonym of \"analysis parameter.\" PARAM must be present and populated on every record in a BDS dataset. PAR AMCD Parameter Code Char Req The short name of the analysis parameter in PARAM. The values of PARAMCD must be no more than 8 characters in length, start with a letter (not underscore), and be comprised only of letters (A - Z), underscore (_), and numerals (0 - 9). These constraints will allow for a BDS dataset to be transposed in such a way that the values of PARAMCD can be used as valid ADaM variable names per Section 3.1.1, General Variable Conventions .

SDTM -- TEST is designed to work in conjunction with other variables called \"qualifiers\" (e.g., specimen type, machine type, body position) in order to describe the collected result. In contrast, the ADaM BDS variable PARAM does not have any accompanying qualifier variabl es. PARAM is the only variable that describes AVAL or AVALC. Qualifiers are not allowed. PARAM is created to meet an analysis need, not just because something was collected. PARAM may describe an analysis value tha t is highly derived from subject data from any combination of SDTM domains of any class or classes, and/or any ADaM dataset. PARAM describes what is in AVAL or AVALC.",

That both -- STRESC and -- STRESN are present and populated in SDTM Findings class domains does not imply that both AVAL and AVALC must be present and populated in BDS datasets. AVAL and AVALC have a di fferent purpose than -- STRESN and -- STRESC. For example, for parameters corresponding to numeric tests in SDTM Finding s class domains, it is not recommended to copy SDTM -- STRESC into AVALC, because there is no analysis need for a character value. Further, doing so may result in breaking the one - to - one mapping requirement in some cases. If it is desired for traceability o r listing purposes to bring the value of -- STRESC into the ADaM dataset, the variable -- STRESC may be copied as is without renaming it. AVAL and AVALC are both populated only when one - to - one mapping may be useful, for example: • When PARAM describes the numeric score of an individual question from a questionnaire, AVAL contains the score, and AVALC can be populated with the question answer text. Populating AVALC with the question answer text is supportive of review, and may help the consu mer understand the me aning of the numeric score that is the subject of the parameter. Within the parameter, there is a one - to - one relationship between AVAL and AVALC on the rows on which both are populated. • When PARAM describes a character - valued response from a set of possibl e values, the result is contained in AVALC. If desired for ordering or other reasons, AVAL can also be populated, as long as the result of populating both AVAL and AVALC for the parameter is that they a re a one - to - one map on the rows on which both are popu lated.

The variable DTYPE (see Table 3.3.5.1) is to be used to identify records within a given parameter that contain these special - case analysi s values. The value of DTYPE indicates the method used for populating the analysis value; a null value of DTYPE indicates the a nalysis value was not a special case. The metadata for AVAL (or AVALC) will give further information about the details of any alg orithm or statistical method used to derive or impute these values.

If the value is missing, then the analysis value is populated using a specific imputation method. It is helpful to be able to identi fy the \"special case\" instances when the analysis value is imputed rather than copied from SDTM, as well as knowing what imputation method was used. • Consider a situation where the analysis value for a parameter is populated based on the subject's corresponding value in anot her parameter or dataset, unless the value is outside a specified range. If the value is outside the range, then the analysis value will instead be populated with a pre - specified constant. It is helpful to be able to identify the \"special case\" instances where the analysis value was out of range and the refore replaced with a constant. • Conside r a situation where, in addition to a subject's analysis value for each visit, an additional timepoint is to be identified called \"POST - BASELINE\" with the analysis value populated with an average of the analysis values from the subject's on - treatment visit s. Though it is possible to identify the \"special case\" analysis values by looking at the value of AVISIT, DTYPE also facilitates the identification as well as provid ing information about the algorithm used. See the CDISC Notes for DTYPE for a list of situ ations in which DTYPE should be populated. Examples of these instances are: • A new record has been created within a parameter to facilitate a cross - timepoint derivation such as endpoint, minimum, maximum, and average post - baseline, with the analysis value c alculated according to the derivation algorithm (See Section 4.5.3, Identification of Post - Baseline Conceptual Timepoint Records ). • A new record has been created within a parameter to represent a missing timepoint for a subject, with an imputed analysis value (see Section 4.5.1, Identification of Records Used in a Timepoint Imputation Analysis ). • The analysis value on an existing record has been modified according to a pre - specified a lgorithm (e.g., setting AVAL to a pre - specified constant for results outside of a pre - specified range, replacing a missing AVAL based on a pre - specified algorithm).",

DTYPE is used to denote, and must be populated, when the value of AVAL or AVALC has been imputed or derived differently than the other analysis values within the parameter. DTYPE is required to be populated even if AVAL and AVALC are null on the derived record. Three common situations when DTYPE should be populated: • A new row is added within a parameter with the analysis value populated based on other rows within the parameter. • A new row is added within a parameter with the analysis value populated based on a constant value or data from other subjects. • An analysis value (AVAL or AVALC) on an existing record is being replaced with a value based on a pre - specified algorithm. DTYPE is used to denote analysis values that are \"special cases\" within a parameter.

Primary candidates for datapoint traceability, when used in conjunction with USUBJID, include the dataset or domain name, the name of the source variable, and the relevant sequence number (SDTM domain - ‑SEQ value or the ADaM ASEQ value). The ADaM ASEQ variable (see Table 3.3.1.1 ) facilitates datapoint traceability by providing sequence numbers t hat are unique within a subject within an ADaM dataset, ensuring uniqueness of a record when used in combination with USUBJID. Table 3.3.9.1 defines additional variables useful in certain situations to facilitate datapoint traceability. These variables ar e useful in situations where a single ADaM dataset or multiple SDTM datasets and/or ADaM datasets were used to create an ADaM dataset. Section 4.4, Inclusion of Input Data That Are Not Analyzed But That Support a Deri vation in the ADaM Dataset , contains an example of how to use these variables.

For example, the SDTM ITT Supplemental Quali fier may not match the ADaM ITTFL indicator variable for a given subject. These population indicators may not match because of operational issues. It is entirely possible that an organization could inherit an SDTM database that for various reasons cannot be changed. It is not incumbent on those creating ADaM datasets to go back and \"fix\" the SDTM population supplemental qualifiers and there may be good reason not to do so. The ADaM Team agrees that it would be best if the SDTM subject - level population suppl emental qualifiers are in harmony with the ADaM population indicator variables, but it is important to recognize that there may be situations where they differ. There are additional ADaM subject - level population flags that do not have counterparts in SDTM. ADaM also supports parameter - level and record - level population flags, which do not exist in the SDTM. Similarly , a baseline record identified in the SDTM dataset may not be the record identified in an ADaM dataset, and there are many reasons why this may occur. There are ADaM parameters that are highly derived and do not have simple counterparts in a Findings domain. An ADaM parameter may be derived from SDTM data spanning multiple domains and classes. Such a parameter would not exist in the SDTM and so it s baseline could only exist in the ADaM dataset. Also, it may be necessary to have separate baselines for different periods within a study, for example to support analyses of change from screening baseline, double - blind treatment baseline, and open - label e xtension baseline (see Section 4.2.1.6, Rule 6.",

      "content": "4.2 Creation of Derived Columns Versus Creation of Derived Rows This section provides specific rules to use in building a BDS dataset. These rules are essential, because they ensure the BDS dataset is analysis - focused, with all analysis - enabling variables and supportive v ariables included in a predictable structure, while preventing a \"horizontalization\" of the dataset. The rows (i.e., records) in the ADaM BDS represent subject data for analysis parameters and timepoints (as applicable). There may be multiple rows within a given combination of subject, parameter, and timepoint, depending on the number of observations collected or derived, baseline definition, etc. The ADaM BDS structure contains a central set of columns (i.e., variables) that represent the data being analyz ed. These variables include the value being analyzed (e.g., AVAL) and the description of the value being analyzed (e.g., PARAM). Other columns in the dataset provide more information about the value being analyzed (e.g., the subject identification) or desc ribe and trace its derivation (e.g., DTYPE) or support its analysis (e.g., treatment variables, covariates). Standard columns exist for a variety of purposes, such as SDTM record identifiers for traceability, population and other record selection flags, an alysis values, and some standard functions of analysis values. Permissible columns are not limited to those whose variable names are specified in Section 3, Standard ADaM Variables , and may include study - specific analysis model covariates, subgrouping variables, variables supportive of traceability, and other variables needed for analysis or useful for review. The BDS is flexible in that derived data can be added to the collected data as additional rows and column s that support the analyses and provide traceability. However, there are some constraints on how to incorporate derived data in the BDS dataset. This section addresses when derived data that are functions of analysis values should be added as additional columns, and when they should be added as additional rows instead. The precise sequence of steps involved in creating a BDS dataset varies according to operational and study - specific needs. For the purposes of this discussion, it is useful to consider 2 fund amental steps. 1. Create an initial dataset from the source datasets. The first step is to create a set of rows and columns more or less directly derived from or loaded from input datasets (primarily SDTM datasets and other ADaM datasets) into their appropriate places. This step will include creation and population of columns containing analysis parameter (PARAM), analysis timepoint (e.g., AVISIT) and analysis values (e.g., AVAL, AVALC). It would also include adding columns containing identifiers (e.g., STUDYI D, USUBJID, SUBJID, SITEID) and other SDTM variables for traceability (e.g., VISIT, -- SEQ).

The second step consists of adding derived rows and columns based on the initial set of ADaM dataset records and columns. The rules below govern this step . These rules are further described and illustrated in the remaining subsections of this section. Rul e 1: A parameter - invariant function of AVAL and BASE on the same row that does not involve a transform of BASE should be added as a new column. Rule 2: A transformation of AVAL that does not meet the conditions of Rule 1 should be added as a new parameter, and AVAL should contain the transformed value. Rule 3: A function of one or more rows within the same parameter for the purpose of creating an analysis timepoint should be added as a new row for the same parameter. Rule 4: A function of multiple rows with in a parameter should be added as a new parameter. Rule 5: A function of more than one parameter should be added as a new parameter. Rule 6: When there is more than one definition of baseline, each additional definition of baseline requires the creation of its own set of rows. It is important to understand that the rules outlined here are specific to rows and columns that are created based on data already present in the ADaM dataset. The rules do not apply to data that are copied or derived directly from ot her datasets (either SDTM or ADaM, or both). For example, how to include a transformation of AVAL within the same dataset is governed by the rules, but the inclusion of a covariate derived from another dataset (e.g., inclusion of a variable from ADSL) is n ot governed by these rules.",

The conditions of Rule 1 for when a function of AVAL and BASE should be added as a column (i.e., a function column) are: 1. the function is of AVAL and, optionally, BASE, on the same row; and 2. the function is parameter - invariant; and 3. the function does not involve a transform of BASE. The remainder of the discussion of this rule is devoted to explaining these conditions. PARAM uniquely describes the contents of AVAL or AVALC. Often, AVAL itself is not the value that is needed for analys is. For example, in a change from baseline analysis, it is the change from baseline CHG that is analyzed. The change from baseline column CHG should be created according to Rule 1 because it satisfies the three conditions: 1. CHG is derived from AVAL and BAS E on the same row. 2. The same calculation applies on all rows in the dataset on which CHG is populated (the function CHG=AVAL - BASE does not vary according to PARAM). This second condition is known as the property of parameter - invariance; unless listed in Sec tion 3 , Standard ADaM Variables , a function of AVAL (and optionally BASE) may not be derived as a column if it is parameter - variant (i.e., is calculated differently for different parameters). 3. In the function CHG= AVAL - BASE, BASE is not transformed. Table 4.2.1.1.1 illustrates the CHG column. Note that the producer elected not to populate CHG on the screening or run - in rows, as they are pre - baseline.

Therefore, if it is desired to perform change from baseline analysis in LOG10, columns for LOG10, baseline of LOG10 and change from baseline of LOG10 would be needed for analysis and review, then the Log10 transformation should instead be created as a new parameter, so that the usual columns AVAL, BASE, and CHG can be used. This is because columns for baseline of LOG10 and change from baseline of LOG10 would not satisfy the conditions of Rule 1. Baseline of LOG10 violates the first condition, becaus e it is not generally a function of AVAL on the same row (does not generally vary by AVAL), and instead is a function only of AVAL on the baseline row. \"Change from baseline of LOG10\" = LOG10(AVAL) - LOG10(BASE) violates the third condition, because it con tains the Log10 transform of BASE. The intent is to use the standard columns as much as possible, to keep the structure as standard as possible, and avoid undue \"horizontalization,\" while still permitting efficient use of function columns. Any function tha t satisfies the three conditions of Rule 1 is allowed as a column. If the function is listed in Section 3, Standard ADaM Variables , then the ADaM standard column name must be used just as CHG is used in Table 4.2.1.1.1.",

If the intention is to redefine AVAL, BASE, CHG, etc. in terms of a transform of AVAL, t hen a new parameter must be added in which PARAM describes the transform. The creation of a new parameter results, by definition, in the creation of a new set of rows. For example, as described in the discussion of Rule 1, in a change from baseline analysis of the logarithm of weight, AVAL should contain the log of weight, BASE should contain the baseline value of the log of weight, and CHG should contain the difference between the two. PARAM should contain a description of the transformed data contained in AVAL, e.g., \"Log10 (Weight (kg))\". In this way the ADaM standard accommodates an analysis of transformed data in the standard columns without creating a multiplicity of new special - purpose columns. In Table 4.2.1.2.1, the producer has chosen values of AVI SITN that correspond to week number and which serve well for sorting and for plotting. VISITNUM is the SDTM visit number.

In SDTM Findings domains (e.g., LB, QS, EG), the -- STRESN column is the only numeric result column, and is also the only standardized numeric result column. The -- ORRES col umn contains a character representation of the collected result, in the collected units specified in the -- ORRESU column. The -- ORRES column is not standardized. So, for example, if data are typically collected in conventional units, the SDTM cannot accomm odate standardized data in both conventional units and the International System of Units (SI). In the SDTM, for any given -- TEST, a producer can standardize in 1 system of units but not 21. If one wishes to be able to analyze standardized results in both c onventional units and SI units, a transform in an ADaM dataset is needed. In each such case, a new parameter must be created in order to accommodate standardized data in the other system of units. The description in the PARAM column must contain the units, as well as any other information, such as location and specimen type, that is needed to ensure that PARAM uniquely describes what is in AVAL, and differentiates between parameters as needed. PARAM cannot be the same for different units. Table 4.2.1.2.2 sh ows an example of data supporting analyses of low - density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in both conventional units (mg/dL) and SI units (mmol/L). In this study, SDTM cholesterol data were standardized in mg/dL. In the ADaM dataset, two records, one for eac h system of units, were generated from each original SDTM record.",

Such derivations should result in the creation of new derived records within th e same parameter. As described in Section 4.10.5, Copying Values onto a New Record , as a general rule, when a record is derived from a single record in the dataset, retain on the derived record any variable values from the original record that do not change and that make sense in the context of the new record (e.g., -- SEQ, VISIT, VISITNUM, -- TPT, covariates).

In this case, a new row should be added, with a corresponding description in AVISIT, and the DTYPE (de rivation type) column should contain a description on that row such as \"AVERAGE\" to indicate both that the row was derived, and also the derivation method. The metadata associated with AVISIT = Endpoint should adequately describe which records are used in the definition of the average. Note that even though the set of records for the log transformation of weight are derived, DTYPE is not populated for every row. DTYPE should be used to indicate rows that are derived within a given value of PARAM and is not to be used as an indication of whether the record exists in SDTM. In Table 4.2.1.3.1, VISITNUM is not retained on the derived record because VISITNUM is not constant on the precursor records, and also makes no sense in the derived analysis timepoint, which is an average that in most cases will span multiple visits. Similarly VSSEQ is not constant across multiple original records, so VSSEQ is not populated on the derived record. PARAM and BASE should be retained because they are constant on the precursor rec ords and make sense in the context of the new record. For the new record, AVAL and change are recalculated, and AVISIT, AVISITN, and DTYPE are populated appropriately.

For example, assume the SAP states that if the subject is off drug for 7 days prior to a visit, the measurement collected at that visit is not included in the per - protocol analysis. Then, for some subjects, the last 2 available values may be different for intent - to - treat (ITT) and for per - protocol analyses, so that the calculated endpoint averages would be different. For such subjects, 2 distinct derived endpoint rows would be needed, the appropriate row for each analysis indicated by the record - level population flags ITTRFL and PPROTRFL. In Table 4.2.1.3.2, the analyzed endpoint value varies according to the population. For example, for PARAM=Weight (kg), the last 2 available ITT values are 92 and 95, whose average is 93.5; whereas the last 2 per - protocol values are 94 and 92, whose average is 93. That is why 2 derived endpoint rows are required for this subject. For other subjects, the I TT and per - protocol data that are input to the endpoint average may be the same; in that case, only 1 endpoint record would be needed, on which ITTRFL and PPROTRFL would both be set to Y. Values of AVISIT and AVISITN are producer - controlled. As in the exam ple in Table 4.2.1.4, the producer decided to set AVISITN to 9999 on the derived AVISIT = Endpoint records.

However, for this subject, either there was no visit 6, or there was a visit 6, but no data on blood pressure were collected. The SAP says that missi ng post - baseline data should be imputed (derived) by 2 methods: last observation carried forward (LOCF) and worst observation carried forward (WOCF). For LOCF analysis, the missing week 8 result was imputed by carrying forward the most recent prior availab le post - baseline value, which is the VISITNUM 5 value. That the week 8 value was imputed is indicated by LOCF in the derivation type (DTYPE) column. For WOCF analysis, even though the unscheduled VISITNUM 4.1 value was not chosen to represent the week 2 an alysis timepoint, it was used to impute the missing week 8 timepoint because it was the worst post - baseline result up to that point.

Analysis relative day (ADY) in this protocol is defined relative to date of first dose. In many but not all protocols, ADY would equal the value of the SDTM -- DY variable (or -- STDY for some kinds of data). The data presented here illustrate that this particular subject did not take drug until 2 days after randomization, so the value of ADY is - 2 at the randomization visit, visit 3 (VISITNUM 3).

The variable ANL01FL is used in this study to identify the record selected for analysis when there are multiple records for a giv en AVISIT, and must be used in conjunction with other selection variables in order to identify the exact set of records used in a given analysis or summary. APERIODC is the crossover period character description. Note that, in general, APERIODC is not the same as EPOCH. For example, it is possible in some cases that boundaries of APERIO Ds woul d not align exactly with boundaries of EPOCHs. A simple example is a post - discontinuation record that is associated with the most recent treatment period for analysis. TRTSEQP, from ADSL, is the planned ordering of crossover treatments. TRTP is the treatme nt variable that will be used in the analysis of this dataset. The 2 endpoint records are derived only for the subjects who have data for both periods. The conventions used in AVISITN are producer - defined. In this example, the producer has decided that AVISITN contains the values - 0.5, 9998, and 9999 for derived baseline, period 1 endpoint, and period 2 endpoint records, respectively, and week number otherwise. It should be noted that in this example, the producer elected to define APERIOD only for the on -t reatment visits, therefore leaving TRTP, APERIOD, and APERIODC empty on other records. This is not meant to imply a standard or best practice.

To assess efficacy, it is important to look at the cumulative effect over time on CD4 cell count duri ng follow - up after administration. Let AVAL(t) equal the value of CD4 cell count at post - baselin e visit t, and let VISITDY(t) be the planned study day of visit t. CD4AUC (cumulative daily CD4 count over follow - up) is calculated at any given post - baseline visit as follows: • CD4AUC at baseline visit is set to 0. • CD4AUC(t) = CD4AUC(t - 1) + [ 0.5 * AVAL(t - 1) + 0.5 * AVAL(t) ] * [ VISITDY(t) - VISITDY(t - 1) ]. CD4AUC is not a simple same - row function of BASE and AVAL. It is calculated based on data from multiple observations (rows) of CD4 data, so it should be added as a new parameter rather than as a new column. CD4AUC is not defined pre - baseline, which is why there is no W eek - 1 for this parameter. CD4AUCMB (cumulative average change from baseline in daily CD4 count over follow - up) is calculated as • CD4AUCMB(t) = CD4AUC(t) / [ VISITDY(t) - 1 ] - baseline value of CD4 cell count. CD4AUCMB is a function of both CD4AUC and the baseline value of CD4, so it also must be its own parameter (see Section 4.2.1.5, Rule 5 ). CD4AUCMB is not defined for pre - baseline and baseline records and therefore these records are not represented within this value of PARAM.

In the example in Table 4.2.1.5.1, blood samples are drawn at every visit, and laboratory test measurements of total choleste rol and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol are found in t he SDTM LB dataset. The protocol calls for analysis of each individual lab analyte, and also for an analysis of the ratio of total cholesterol (C) to high - density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The ADaM dataset contains parameters for each of the two measured lab tests, as well as a new set of derived rows where the description in PARAM is \"Total Cholesterol:HDL - C ratio\", and AVAL contains the calculated ratio at each timepoint. The analysis of percent change from baseline (PCHG) is of interest for all thre e parameters and is therefore populated on all records. In general, however, if percent change is not analyzed for a particular value of PARAM, then it is not necessary to populate PCHG for those rows.

In case there is more than 1 definition of baseline in an ADaM dataset, new rows must be created for each additional alternat ive definition of baseline. There will therefore be multiple sets of rows, where each set of rows corresponds to a particular definition of baseline. Whenever there is more than 1 definition of baseline, the BASETYPE column is required. BASETYPE identifies the definition of baseline that corresponds to the value of BASE in each row. There is only 1 BASE column, and only 1 column for each qualifying function of AVAL and BASE. Table 4.2.1.6.1 presents a dataset supporting shift analysis from three different baselines. Accordingly, it makes use of the BASET YPE variable described above. The ANRIND, BNRIND, and SHIFTy variables are also illustrated.

It could also be that there are multiple ways to construct a particular baseline value (e.g., last value prior to treatment, average value at the baseline visit, minimum value prior to t reatment, etc.). For a given parameter, whenever there is more than 1 definition of baseline, BASETYPE is required and must be populated. For any given parameter and subject, whenever there is more than 1 definition of baseline, the number of records flagged with ABLFL=Y is equal to the number of va lues of BASETYPE. 4.3 In clusion of All Observed and Derived Records for a Parameter Versus the Subset of Records Used for Analysis This section discusses whether the ADaM dataset should include all rows of an analysis parameter, or only the subset of rows that are used for analys is. A value of AVAL or AVALC for an analysis parameter at a specific timepoint may be observed (i.e., collected on the case report form o r in an electronic diary at that timepoint), it may be imputed because it was missing, or it may be derived from a comb ination of other values. To illustrate the issue being presented, assume that the total scores for questionnaire A (administered at visits 1, 2, and 3 ) are in the SDTM QS dataset as illustrated below. Any missing total scores are imputed by carrying the la st post - baseline (post - visit 1) total score forward. The total score for visit 3 will be analyzed.",

ADaM Methodology The ADaM metho dology is to include all observed and derived rows for a given analysis parameter. The inclusion of all the rows in the ADaM dataset, including those not used in the analysis, requires a way to identify the rows used in the specified analysis.

In addition, the data are also then available to enable other analys es, including sensitivity analyses. However, this approach increases the size of the dataset; it also introduces a risk that the appropriate selection criteria will not be used, producing incorrect analysis results. Regulatory reviewers prefer that the path followed in creating and/or selecting analysis rows be clearly delineated and traceable all the way back to the originating rows in the SDTM dataset, if possible and within reason. Simply including the algorithm in the metadata is often not sufficient, a s any complicated data manipulations may not be clearly identified (e.g., how missing pieces of the input data were handled). Retaining in one dataset all of the observed and derived rows for the analysis parameter provides the clearest traceability in the most flexible manner within the standard BDS. The resulting dataset also provides the most flexibility for testing the robustness of an analysis (e.g., using a different imputation method). Example 1 In the example discussed above (Table 4.3.1), the ADaM dataset would contain the following rows (Table 4.3.2) for the total score parameter: Table 4.3.2 Example 1: ADaM Dataset Row PARAMCD USUBJID VISITNUM AVISITN AVISIT AVAL DTYPE QSSEQ 1 TOTSCORE 0001 1 1 Visit 1 7 101 2 TOTSCORE 0001 2 2 Visit 2 12 201 3 TOTSCORE 0001 3 3 Visit 3 14 555 4 TOTSCORE 0002 1 1 Visit 1 4 91 5 TOTSCORE 0003 1 1 Visit 1 2 156 6 TOTSCORE 0003 2 2 Visit 2 6 300 7 TOTSCORE 0003 2 3 Visit 3 6 LOCF 300 For the analysis discussed above, the data to be analyzed are selected by specifying that AVISITN = 3 (or AVISIT = Visit 3). It should be noted that this approach does not require the inclusion of all rows from the input dataset. For example, if the SDTM QS dataset contains data for several different questionnaires, then data from questionnaires other than the one being analyzed do not have to be included in the ADaM dataset. Example 2 In this example, the Q01 assessment is scheduled to be performed at visits 1, 3, 5, and 7, and results are to be summarized at those visits.

There were multiple observations for subject 3023 at AVISITN = 5 and therefore, in this example, rows with ANL01FL = \"Y\" are the ones that have been chosen to represent their respective analysis timepoints. • ANL01FL is null for subject 1099 for VISIT = \"VISIT 2\" (row 2) because visit 2 is an unscheduled visit for this questionnaire and visit 2 will not be presented in the analyses; AVISITN and AVISIT are also null because they do not map to visits used for analyses described in the study's an alysis plan. • The combination of \"(ANL01FL = \"Y\" and FASFL = \"Y\" and AVISITN = 5)\" identifies the rows used in a FAS analysis of visit 5 data. Approaches Considered and Not Adopted The other approach considered was to include in the ADaM dataset only the ro ws that are actually used in the analysis of the analysis parameter. In Example 1 above, only visit 3 rows that were either observed or derived by LOCF would be included in the ADaM dataset. The main advantage of this approach would be to simplify the anal ysis, as no selection clause would need to be used to identify the appropriate rows for inclusion in the analysis. However, the primary disadvantages would be the loss of traceability and the loss of flexibility for testing the robustness of the analysis. Because of these disadvantages, this approach was not chosen.",

Section 4.3 is a simple case of a more general topic addressed in this section. This section addresses the broader issue of whether an ADaM dataset should contain the input data used in the derivation of the analysis data as well as the actual data being analyzed. This inc ludes: • Input data rows and columns to support traceability of the derivation of analyzed rows and columns • Raw or derived predecessor parameters that are not analyzed themselves but are used to derive an analyzed parameter These input data rows and columns could come from a single dataset or multiple datasets as necessary to derive the analysis data captured in AVAL or AVALC, as described by the analysis parameter. ADaM Methodology ADaM datasets are developed to facilitate intended analyses. In the ADaM Mod el document, it is assumed that the original data sources for ADaM datasets are SDTM datasets, even when ADaM datasets are derived from other ADaM datasets.

All rights reserved Page 67 2021-11-29 The ADaM methodology to achieve the expected traceability is to describe the derivation algorithms in the metadata and, if practical and feasible, to include supportive rows as appropriate for traceability. To include the input data as rows in the ADaM dataset, columns should be added where feasible to indicate the source of the input data. While this methodology increases both the size of the dataset and the complexity of selecting the appropriate rows for analysis, it also provides input data in an immediately accessible manner. In addition, intermediate values can be retained if appropriate flags are used to distinguish them. In general, it is strongly recommended to include as much supporting data as is needed for traceability. Ho wever, there are situations in which this may not be practical. For example, if an analyzed parameter is a summary derived from a very large number of raw e - diary input records, it may be neither useful nor practical to include all of the raw e- diary recor ds as rows in the ADaM dataset. The remainder of this section addresses cases where the ADaM datasets contain not only the analysis data but also input data that are necessary to provide clearer traceability of the algorithms used to derive the analysis da ta. In addition to the actual values used in the analysis, the dataset may include rows not used in the analysis, rows containing input data, and rows containing intermediate values computed during the derivation of the analysis data. Flags or other column s are used to distinguish the various data types as well as to provide a traceable path from the input data to the value used in the analysis. The analysis results metadata specify how the appropriate rows are identified (by a specific selection clause). The identification of rows used in an analysis is addressed in Sections 4.5, Identification of Records Used for Analysis , and 4.6, Identification of Population - specific Analyzed Records . Unless the input data are already present as column(s) on the row (e.g., as covariate(s) or supportive variable(s)), the input data will be retained as rows in the ADaM dataset. The analysis value column (AVAL and/or AVALC) on the retained input d ata row will contain a value for the analysis parameter.",

This approach allows the inclusion of input data from multiple domains. If the input data are already included in columns on the analysis parameter row (e.g., as covariates or supportive information), there is no need to include additional rows for those input data. The decision regarding keeping the input data as rows or columns will therefore be dictated by the types of input data and whether they are used for other purposes in the ADaM dataset. Retaining in one dataset all data used in the determination of the analysis parameter value will provide the clearest traceability in the most flexible manner within the standard ADaM BDS. This large dataset also provides the most flexibility for testing the robustness of an analysis. If it is determined t hat this large dataset is too cumbersome, the producer can choose to provide two datasets, one that contains all rows and another that is a subset of the first, containing only the rows used in the specified analysis. To ensure traceability, the metadata f or the subset ADaM dataset will refer back to the full ADaM dataset as the immediate predecessor. This approach provides the needed traceability along with a dataset that can be used in an analysis without specifying a selection clause.

AVAL for PARAMCD = \"HOSPADM\" is the earliest relative day of hospitalization. AVAL for PARAMCD = \"DBP\" is the earliest relative day that diastolic blood pressure exceeded 90. AVAL for PARAMCD=\"SBP\" is the earliest relative day that systolic blood pressure exceeded 140. If a subject did not experience a particular sub - event, a row is still created for that sub - event indicating the subject was censored (CNSR=1) on the day the subject exited the study and the SRC* columns reference the Disposition (DS) dataset. AVAL for PARAMCD = \"HYPEREVT\" is derived as the earliest event of the 3: HOSPADM, DBP, and SBP (the minimum AVAL of those 3 that have CNSR = 0 will be the earliest relative day of the 3 types of events); a subject who meets 1 of these 3 conditions has CNSR = 0 for PARAMCD = \"HYPEREVT\" to indicate the subject had an event. If a subject does not meet 1 of the 3 conditions (i.e., all 3 records have CNSR = 1), then the subject is cen sored; that is, AVAL for PARAMCD = \"HYPEREVT\" is derived as the relative day that the subject exited the study and CNSR = 1 is used to indicate the subject is censored.",

Pointer columns would be added to indicate the source of the input data (e.g., variable name, sequence number). This option would allow all pertinent input data to be retained on the relevant analyzed row (i.e., all sub - events would be shown on the same row as a compound event), which might help si mplify verification of the calculation of the analysis parameter. However, this approach would clearly increase the number of columns in the ADaM dataset and would require naming the variables in a clear and concise manner. The approach also assumes that t he only data to be retained are the original input values. Another drawback of this approach is that if there were a need in the future to analyze the sub - events, sub - event parameters would have to be added to have an ADaM - conformant structure supporting the analysis of sub - events. For these reasons, this approach was not chosen. A third approach that was considered was to describe the derivation algorithms in metadata and include no input data or identification of the input data in the ADaM dataset. The advantage of this approach would be simplification of the ADaM dataset. However, due to this simplified structure, there would be a loss of traceability between the data collected in the study (i.e., SDTM dataset) and the data analyzed (i.e., ADaM dataset) . Unless the derivation algorithms described in the metadata were straightforward, verification of the analysis data computation could be very challenging or even impossible.

LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) is one of the most commonly used timepoint - related imputation analyses, and is therefore specifically mentioned. However, the methodology is general and is not restricted to LOCF analysis. WOCF (Worst Observation Carried Forward) analysis is also mentioned to emphasize the generalizab ility. ADaM Methodology When an analysis timepoint is missing, the ADaM methodology is to create a new record in the ADaM dataset to represent the missing timepoint and identify these imputed records by populating the derivation type variable DTYPE. For ex ample, when an LOCF/WOCF analysis is being performed, create LOCF/WOCF records when the LOCF/WOCF analysis timepoints are missing, and identify these imputed records by populating the derivation type variable DTYPE with values LOCF or WOCF. All of the orig inal records would have null values in DTYPE. It would be very simple to select the appropriate records for analysis by selecting DTYPE = null for Data as Observed (DAO) analysis, DTYPE = null or LOCF for LOCF analysis, and DTYPE = null or WOCF for WOCF an alysis. This approach would require understanding and communicating that if the DTYPE flag were not referenced correctly, the analysis would default to using all records, including the DAO records, plus the records derived by LOCF and WOCF.

This approach would make it more foolproof to perform the DAO, LOCF, and WOCF analyses in one step by referencing only AVISIT. However, because so many records would be duplicated, a very large dataset is one of the major disadvantages for this approach. In addition, this approach might be less tool - friendly, in that one might need to parse AVISIT searching for a key substring such as \"(LOCF).\" This approach should not be used. A third approach considered is to create a flag (LOCFFL/LOCFFN) to indicate when a record is created by virtue of last observation carried forward, and similarly for WOCF. This is similar to the specified ADaM methodology, except that a separate flag is created for each derivation type, rather than ind icating row derivation type in 1 column DTYPE. This approach might result in fewer records than the recommended approach (e.g., if the WOCF record is CDISC Analysis Data Model Implementation Guide (",

      "content": "4.5.2 Identification of Baseline Records Many statistical analyses require the identification of a baseline value. This section describes how a record used as a baseline is identified. ADaM Methodology The ADaM methodology is to create a baseline flag column to indicate the record used as baseline (the record whose value of AVAL is used to populate the BASE variable). This method does not require duplic ation of records in the event that the baseline record is not derived. Although a baseline record flag variable ABLFL is created and used to identify the record that is the baseline record, this does not prohibit also providing a record with a unique value of AVISIT (e.g., \"Baseline\"), designating the baseline record used for analysis, even if redundant with another record. For more complicated baseline definitions (functions of multiple records), a derived baseline record would have to be created as descri bed in Section 4.2.1.3, Rule 3 . This methodology requires that clear metadata be provided for the baseline record variable so that the value can be reproduced accurately. Example 1: Identification of baseline rows – us ing screening visit to impute a baseline row This example illustrates the use of a baseline flag variable, ABLFL. It also illustrates the inclusion of an additional row for a baseline analysis timepoint (row 6). In this example, a unique value of AVISIT has been defined for the baseline record used for analysis. Subject 1001 had complete data. There was no record that qualified as a baseline value for subject 1002 in the source data. A derived baseline record (AVISIT = \"Baseline\") is added with DTYPE = \"L VPD\" (Last Value Prior to Dosing) to indicate that the record is imputed to be used as baseline. Table 4.5.2.1.

Row 3 is a derived \"Baseline\" record using the average of the values of row 1 and row 2. DTYPE = \"AVERAGE\" to indicate that row 3 is derived. The baseline flag (ABLFL = \"Y\") indicates that AVAL from row 3 is used to populate the BASE (Baseline) column.

      "content": "4.5.3 Identification of Post - Baseline Conceptual Timepoint Records When analysis involves cross - timepoint derivations such as endpoint, minimum, maximum, and average post - baseline, questions such as \"Should distinct records with unique value of AVISIT always be created even if redundant with an observed value record?\" or \"Should these records just be flagged?\" need to be considered. Examples 1 and 2 present the approach of adding records, and Example 3 presents the alternate approach of flagging the records. ADaM Methodology The ADaM methodology is to create a new record with a unique value of AVISIT in cases where analysis is based on AVISIT. The advantage of this approach is that it is simple and analysis - friendly. It is recognized that such new records might be redundant with observed records for som e kinds of conceptual timepoint definitions. Always creating a record with a unique value of AVISIT designating the record used for analysis (e.g., \"Endpoint,\" \"Post - Baseline Minimum,\" \"Post - Baseline Maximum\") has the advantage that once the AVISIT values are understood, producers, consumers, and software can rely on these values of AVISIT. This approach represents the general case because any such cross - timepoint derivation can be represented in a new record with a unique AVISIT description. The disadvantage is that the dataset would contain more records, and conventions would have to be communicated and understood. In cases where analysis is not based on AVISIT, either solution is valid. It is recognized that in cases where the AVISIT values are not define d in the analysis documentation, adding a flag may be more appropriate. Which methodology is appropriate for situations where an \"analysis visit\" value is not defined can be driven by how the analysis will be performed. In cases where only a subset of data is analyzed (e.g., only on treatment minimum values), then flagging the values that qualify for analysis might be a better choice than creating an additional record to contain the minimum value. However, where the subset of data is analyzed within the context of a greater pool of data, creating an additional record to contain the minimum value would help facilitate analysis - ready usage and review.

      "content": "4.5.4 Identification of Records Used for Analysis – General Case It is important to identify the records used in or excluded from analysis. Should records used in the analysis be identified via flags or by unique values of analysis timepoint window description AVISIT? ADaM Methodology The ADaM methodology is to use an analysis flag (ANLzzFL) to indicate the records that fulfill specific requirements for 1 or more analyses. For example, ANLzzFL = Y indicates records meeting the requirements for analysis and is blank (null) in other records, such as a duplicate record that was not the one selected for analysis, or pre - specified post - study timepoints not included in the analysis. This allows multiple records within a parameter with the same value of AVISIT. However, it also requires flags to be added to the dataset to be used in selecting appropriate records for a nalysis. Understanding of the flags is required for correct analysis results to be generated. In addition to ANLzzFL, additional flags might also be required, such as record - based population flags (e.g., ITTRFL, PPROTRFL). Note that there can be multiple ANLzzFL variables. In this case, it will be imperative to have clear and robust metadata to indicate the basis for the creation and population of each ANLzzFL variable. Example 1: Identification of rows used for analysis – multiple visits that fall within a visit window This example illustrates the use of the analysis flag variable ANLzzFL to indicate the rows that were chosen for analysis from among the multiple visits that fall within the analysis timepoint windows of \"Baseline\" and \"Week 2\". Subject 1001 had 2 observed baseline and week 2 analysis timepoints according to analysis window definitions. The one that is used in analysis is flagged with ANL01FL = Y. This approach is used because all original visits (rows) are included in the dataset, and those selected for analysis must be identified. For traceability reasons, the AWTARGET and AWTDIFF columns are included in order to indicate more clearly how the analyzed rows were selected from among the candidate rows within each analysis window. In this examp le, the record that falls closest to the scheduled visit day is the one that will be analyzed. CDISC Analysis Data Model Implementation Guide (",

For example, a measurement that was assessed outside of a pre - specified time window for a particular visit may not be included in a per - protocol visit - level population. In this section, it is assumed that the definition of a record - level analysis population is dependent on the definition of the subject - level population. In other words, if a subject is excluded from the subject - level per - protocol population, then none of that subject's records would be candidates for inclusion within the record - level per - protocol population. Given the variety of possible population definitions, the same record in an analysis dataset could be included in one analysis and excluded from another, depending on characteristics of the subject as a whole and the characteristics of the individual measurement. Therefore , the issue becomes how best to select records for each analysis. ADaM Methodology The ADaM methodology for this analysis issue is to create a single ADaM dataset that can be used to perform multiple analyses using population flag variables to identify records that are used for each type of analysis. An advantage of this approach is that this single ADaM dataset can be used for multiple analyses. Flag variables obviate the need to replicate records for each type of analysis. This approach promotes efficienc y in the operational aspects of electronic submissions, clarity of analyses, and ease in comparing selected values for each population. This approach does, however, require that clear metadata be provided for the flag variables so that each specific analys is can be reproduced accurately. Below are several examples of the use of population flag variables to identify records used for different analyses. Example 1: Use of subject - level flag variables (ITTFL and PPROTFL) and record - level flag variables (ANL01FL and PPROTRFL) In some statistical analyses, even if a subject is included in the per - protocol population, some or all data for that subject in a particular dataset may not be appropriate for a per - protocol analysis. Consider a situation in HIV studies whe re a per - protocol analysis excludes all data after permanent discontinuation of study medication or addition of other antiretroviral therapy.",

This ADaM dataset ca n be used to repeat analyses based on multiple populations of interest either at the subject level or at the record (measurement) level. ITTFL and PPROTFL are subject - level analysis population flags. If a subject is in the intent - to - treat population, then the column ITTFL will have the value of \"Y\" (\"N\" if not). In Table 4.6.1, subjects 1001, 1002, and 1003 are in the intent - to - treat population. Similarly, if a subject is in the per - protocol population, the column PPROTFL will have the value of \"Y\" (\"N\" if not). Subjects 1001 and 1003 in Table 4.6.1 are in the per - protocol population, whereas subject 1002 with PPROTFL = N is excluded from any per - protocol analysis. These indicator variables are used to identify individual subjects that belong to each subject - level population. In contrast to the subject - level population flags, the column PPROTRFL is the per - protocol analysis flag at the record level. As illustrated in Table 4.6.1, if a record is a candidate for the per - protocol analysis, the variable PPROTRFL is set to \"Y\"; it is null if the record does not fulfill the criteria for this analysis. In the example, subjects 1001 and 1002 continue with study medication after week 2; the last dose of study medication for subject 1003 is at week 1. In Table 4.6.1, al l 3 records for subject 1002 and 2 of 4 records for subject 1003 are not record - level per - protocol data and would not be selected for a per - protocol analysis when applying the subset condition: PPROTRFL = \"Y\". PPROTRFL is null on the last 2 records for sub ject 1003 and will be excluded from any record - level per - protocol data analysis as they occur after the subject discontinued study medication. Not all records in Table 4.6.1 are included for analysis purposes. In this example, the analysis flag ANL01FL is null for one record (USUBJID = 1003, VISIT = Week 1, AVISIT = Week 1, AVAL = 999) because its value was replaced by the retest result in the next record (USUBJID = 1003, VISIT = Retest, AVISIT = Week 1, AVAL = 49).

These variables are defined in Section 3.3.4, Analysis Parameter Variables for BDS Datasets . The variables MCRITy and MCRITyML are defined in Section 3.3.4, Analysis Parameter Variables for BDS Datasets , for use in situations where the criterion can have multiple responses (as opposed to CRITy, which has binary responses). CRITy is populated with a text description defining the conditions necessary to satisfy the presence of the criterion. The definition of CRITy can use any variable(s) located on the row, and the definition must stay constant across all rows within the same value of PARAM. A complex criterion which draws from multiple rows (different parameters or multiple rows for a single parameter) will require a new PARAM be created (see Example 3). CRITyFL, \"Criterion Evaluation Result Flag,\" is the character indicator of whether the criterion described in CRITy was met. Variable CRITyFL must be present on the dataset if variable CRITy is present. CRITyFN is permitted if a numeric result flag is needed. ADaM methodology allows the option of only populating CRITy on a row if the CRITy criterion is met for that row (see Example 1). In that case, CRITyFL is set to \"Y\" only if CRITy is populated and is null otherwise. If this option is not used and CRITy is populated on all rows within the parameter (see Example 2), then CRITyFL is set to \"Y\" or \"N\" or null. The choic e of populating CRITy on only the rows where the criteria is met versus on all rows is dependent on the analysis need, as shown in the examples that follow. CRITy and CRITyFL facilitate subgroup analyses. The ADaM methodology does not preclude the addition of rows (in contrast to the addition of multiple CRITy and CRITyFL columns) to the BDS for the criterion CRITy. However, CRITy must be kept constant (if populated) across all rows within the same value of PARAM. CRITy, CRITyFL, and CRITyFN are not paramet er - invariant in that CRITy can vary across parameters within a dataset, as can the controlled terminology used for the corresponding CRITyFL and CRITyFN.",

Example 1: CRITy populated only when criterion met Using this approach, when a criterion is defined for a PARAM but conditions are not met on a specific row, both CRITy and CRITyFL are set to null.

As wi th other examples, some of the necessary columns for analysis and traceability (e.g., CHG, PCHG, AWTARGET, AWTDIFF, LBSEQ) have been excluded from the illustration. In this example, ALT value s are evaluated for changes in toxicity grade. (Laboratory grading in this example is based on CTCAE Version 4, so Grade 1 is >ULN - 3.0 x ULN, Grade 2 is >3.0 - 5.0 x ULN, Grade 3 is >5.0 - 20.0 x ULN, and Grade 4 >20.0 x ULN.) In a typical analysis situation, it is of interest to know the shift in the number of t oxici ty grades from baseline. Generally, an increase from a grade 1 at baseline to a grade 3 at a post - baseline visit is treated the same as an increase from grade 2 to grade 4; that is, both of these are considered an increase in 2 grades. Note that for some l aboratory analytes, only increases in toxicity grades are of interest. For other analytes, the interest is only in decreases in toxicity grades.

In contrast, CRIT1 assesses whether the value of ALT exceeded 8 times ULN. Note that, in this example, the producer has elected to not populate the values of MCRIT1ML on the screening and baseline records. Values of MCRIT1ML represent the number of grade increases from baseline. Note that for visits where there is either no increase in toxicity grade or where the grade decreases, MCRIT1ML is given a value of \"No Grade Increase\". This approach is suitable for analytes where onl y grade increase is of intere st. Should decreases also be of interest, then a second set of MCRIT variables would be added to contain the observed number of toxicity grade decreases. This example also illustrates other BDS variables, notably SHIFT1 and SHIFT2. SHIFT1 is defined as the shift between BNRIND and ANRIND whereas SHIFT2 is the shift between BTOXGR and ATOXGR.

For example, suppose an analysis is to be performed for the data obtained at each of 4 visits and that no imputation is to be performed. For subjects who did not attend all 4 visits, it would be possible to create records in t he ADaM dataset for these missed assessments, with AVAL and AVALC missing (null) and appropriate variable(s) set to indicate these added records. For example, DTYPE could contain a producer - defined value such as \"PHANTOM.\" There are some advantages of havi ng an ADaM dataset contain the same number of observations for each subject. Programming is facilitated by having the same data dimensions for all subjects, and by explicitly representing missing data rather than implicitly representing it by the absence o f a record. This also allows ADaM datasets to support listing creation, especially for data that is not present in the source SDTM dataset (e.g., added analysis parameters). For some categorical analyses, the denominators can be obtained directly from the ADaM dataset rather than from another input such as ADSL. The disadvantage of this approach is that it may require additional metadata to explain the use of these derived blank records and would require in some cases that subsetting statements be used to e xclude the rows on which AVAL is missing. In general, the ADaM Team neither advocates nor discourages this practice for BDS datasets.",

      "content": "4.10.4 Traceability when the Multiple Imputation Method Is Used There has been increased attention in the analysis of clinical trial data to address problems associated with mis sing data, and with this increased attention has come new ways to deal with this problem. In the past, simple methods such as LOCF (last observation carried forward) or BLOCF (baseline observation carried forward) were routinely used to replace missing values. Such single - point imputation methods have been shown to underestimate the standard error of the estimates of various statistics computed from the data. A more sophisticated method, multiple imputation, was introduced in 1987 and is now fully supported by frequently used software packages. In brief, this methodology deals with the uncertainty of the missing data by employing a 3 - step process. The first step is the creation of multiple datasets in which plausible values for each missing data value are im puted. The second step is to analyze each of these datasets with the desired statistical procedure and capture the resulting statistical estimates. The third and final step is to use these estimates to generate a combined (pooled) estimate. It is these est imates which are based on the pooling of the estimates from the multiple imputation datasets that are used to evaluate statistical significance. Using the SAS software as an example, the above 3 - step process is achieved using PROC MI to create the multiple datasets (step 1). Step 2 would utilize the procedure associated with the desired statistical model, such as PROC LOGISTIC. Step 3 would use PROC MIANALYZE to create the combined pooled estimates. In ADaM, the documentation of derived variables via variab le level metadata, and statistical results via analysis results metadata, is paramount to achieving the concept of traceability. However, documenting the traceability of estimates created via multiple imputation cannot be achieved with these current metada ta methods. In addition, it would not be practical to include all datasets that are created from the PROC MI process as part of a submission. To address traceability, the ADaM recommendation is to provide the program statements from the 3 procedures mentio ned above as a part of the analysis results metadata. This allows the reviewer to re - create the analysis as desired.",

The output from PROC MI is fed into PROC PHREG, and the hazard ratios are obtaine d. The output is then routed back through PROC MIANALYZE to get the point estimates and confidence intervals. This example shows 6 covariates in the model (represented by generic variables COVAR1 - COVAR6).
