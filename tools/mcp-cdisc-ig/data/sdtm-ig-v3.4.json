Like its predecessors, v3.4 is intended to guide the organization, structure, and format of standard clinical trial tabulation datasets submitted to a regulatory authority. Version 3.4 supersedes all prior versions of the SDTMIG. The SDTMIG should be used in close concert with Version 2.0 of the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundat ional/sdtm ), which describes the general conceptual model for representing clinical study data that is submitted to regulatory authorities and should be read prior to reading the SDTMIG. SDTMIG Version 3.4 provides specific domain models, assumptions, busi ness rules, and examples for preparing standard tabulation datasets that are based on the SDTM. This document is intended for companies and individuals involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical data that will be submitted to regulat ory authorities.",

      "content": "2.1 Observations and Variables The SDTMIG for Human Clinical Trials is based on the SDTM’s genera l framework for organizing clinical trial information that is to be submitted to regulatory authorities. The SDTM is built around the concept of observations collected about subjects who participated in a clinical study. Each observation can be described b y a series of variables, corresponding to a row in a dataset. Each variable can be classified according to its role. A role determines the type of information conveyed by the variable about each distinct observation and how it can be used. Variables can be classified into 5 major roles: • Identifier variables, such as those that identify the study, subject, domain, and sequence number of the record • Topic variables, which specify the focus of the observation (e.g., the name of a lab test) • Timing variables, wh ich describe the timing of the observation (e.g., start date and end date) • Qualifier variables, which include additional illustrative text or numeric values that describe the results or additional traits of the observation (e.g., units, descriptive adjecti ves) • Rule variables, which describe the condition to start, end, branch, or loop in the Trial Design Model The set of Qualifier variables can be further categorized into 5 subclasses: • Grouping Qualifiers are used to group together a collection of observati ons within the same domain. Examples include -- CAT and -- SCAT. • Result Qualifiers describe the specific results associated with the topic variable in a Findings dataset. They answer the question raised by the topic variable. Result Qualifiers are -- ORRES, - - STRESC, and -- STRESN. • Synonym Qualifiers specify an alternative name for a particular variable in an observation. Examples include ‑‑ MODIFY and -- DECOD, which are equivalent terms for a -- TRT or -- TERM topic variable, and - - TEST and ‑‑ LOINC, which are equ ivalent terms for a -- TESTCD. • Record Qualifiers define additional attributes of the observation record as a whole (rather than describing a particular variable within a record).",

A domain is defined as a collection of logically related observations with a common topic. The logic of the relationship may pertain to the scien tific subject matter of the data or to its role in the trial. Each domain is represented by a single dataset. Each domain dataset is distinguished by a unique, 2 - character code that should be used consistently throughout the submission. This code, which is stored in the SDTM variable named DOMAIN, is used in 4 ways: as the dataset CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc.

All datasets are structured as flat files with rows representing observations and columns representing variables. Each dataset is described by metadata definitions that provide information about the variables used in the dataset. The metadata are described in a data definition document (i.e., a Define - XML document) that is submitted with the data to regulatory authorities.

In most cases, the choice of observation class appropriate to a specific c ollection of data can be easily determined according to these descriptions. The majority of data, which typically consists of measurements or responses to questions, usually at specific visits or time points, will fit the Findings general observation class .

Decisions on what data to collect should be based on the scientific objectives of the study, rather than the SDTM. Note that any data collected that will be submitt ed in an analysis (ADaM) dataset must be traceable to a source in a tabulation (SDTM) dataset. The collected data for a given study may use standard domains from this and other SDTM implementation guides as well as additional custom domains based on the 3 general observation classes. A list of standard domains is provided in Section 3.2.1, Dataset - level Metadata . Final domains will be published only in an SDTM implementation guide (this guide or another implementation guide, e.g., SDTMIG for Medical Devices). Therapeutic - area standards projects and other projects may develop proposals for additional domains. Draft versions of these domains may be made available in the CDISC wiki in the SDTM Draft Domains space ( https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/SDD/SDTM+Draft+Domains+Home ). These general rules apply when determining which variables to include in a domain: • The Identifier variables, STUD YID, USUBJID, DOMAIN, and -- SEQ are required in all domains based on the general observation classes. Other Identifiers may be added as needed. • Any Timing variables are permissible for use in any submission dataset based on a general observation class exce pt where restricted by specific domain assumptions. • Any additional Qualifier variables from the same general observation class may be added to a domain model except where restricted by specific domain assumptions. • Sponsors may not add any variables other t han those described in the preceding 3 bullets. The SDTM allows for the inclusion of a sponsor's non - SDTM variables using the Supplemental Qualifiers special - purpose dataset structure, described in Section 8.4, Relatin g Non - standard Variable Values to a Parent Domain . As the SDTM continues to evolve, certain additional standard variables may be added to the general observation classes. • Standard variables must not be renamed or modified for novel usage. Their metadata s hould not be changed. • A Permissible variable should be used in an SDTM dataset wherever appropriate. o If a study includes a data item that would be represented in a Permissible variable, then that variable must be included in the SDTM dataset, even if null.

The number of domains submitted should be based on the specific requirements of the study. To create a custom domain, 1. Confirm that none of the existing published domains will fit the need. A custom domain may only be created if the data are different in na ture and do not fit into an existing published domain. o Establish a domain of a common topic; that is, where the nature of the data is the same rather than by a specific method of collection (e.g., electrocardiogram). Group and separate data within the doma in using -- CAT, -- SCAT, -- METHOD, -- SPEC, -- LOC, and so on, as appropriate. Examples of different CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights res erved Page 14 2021 - 11 - 29 topics are: microbiology, tumor measurements, pathology/histology, vital signs, and physical exam results. o Do not create separate domains based on time; rathe r, represent both prior and current observations in a domain (e.g., CM for all non - study medications). Note that Adverse Events (AE) and Medical History (MH) are an exception to this best practice because of regulatory reporting needs. o How collected data a re used (e.g., to support analyses and/or efficacy endpoints) must not result in the creation of a custom domain. For example, if blood pressure measurements are endpoints in a hypertension study, they must still be represented in the Vital Signs (VS) doma in, as opposed to a custom “efficacy” domain. Similarly, if liver function test results are of special interest, they must still be represented in the Laboratory Tests (LB) domain. o Data that were collected on separate CRF modules or pages may fit into an e xisting domain (e.g., as separate questionnaires into the QS domain, prior and concomitant medications in the CM domain). o If it is necessary to represent relationships between data that are hierarchical in nature (e.g., a parent record must be observed bef ore child records), then establish a domain pair (e.g., MB/MS, PC/PP). Note: Domain pairs have been modeled for microbiology data (MB/MS domains) and pharmacokinetics (PK) data (PC/PP domains) to enable dataset - level relationships to be described using REL REC.",

Check the SDTM Draft Domains area of the CDISC wiki ( https://wiki. cdisc.org/display/SDD/SDTM+Draft+Domains+Home ) for proposed domains developed since the last published version of the SDTMIG. These proposed domains may be used as custom domains in a submission. 3. Look for an existing, relevant domain model to serve as a pr ototype. If no existing model seems appropriate, choose the general observation class (Interventions, Events, or Findings) that best fits the data by considering the topic of the observation. As illustrated in the following figure, the general approach for selecting variables for a custom domain is: a.

In addition, the CDISC domain models include 2 shaded columns that are n ot sent to the FDA, but which assist sponsors in preparing their datasets: • The CDISC Notes column provides information regarding the relevant use of each variable. • The Core column indicates how a variable is classified (see Section 4.1.5, SDTM Core Designations ). The domain models in Section 6, Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes , illustrate how to apply the SDTM when creating a specific domain dataset. In particular, these models illustrate the selection of a subset of the variables offered in 1 of the general observation classes, along with applicable timing variables. The models also show how a standard variable from a general observation class should be adjusted to meet the specific content needs of a particular domain, including making the label more meaningful, specifying controlled terminology, and creating domain - specific notes and examples.

      "content": "3.2.1.1 Primary Keys The table in Section 3.2.1, Dataset - level Metadata , shows examples of what a sponsor might submit as variables that comprise the primary key for SDTM datasets. Because the purpose of the Keys column is to aid reviewers in understanding the structure of a dataset, sponsors should list all of the natural keys for the dataset. These keys should define uniqueness for records within a dataset, and may define a record sort order. The identified keys for each dataset should be consistent with the description of the dataset structure as described in the Define - XML document. For all the general observation - class domains (and for some special - purpose domains), the -- SEQ variable was created so that a unique record could be identif ied consistently across all of these domains via its use, along with STUDYID, USUBJID, and DOMAIN. In most domains, -- SEQ will be a surrogate key for a set of variables that comprise the natural key. In certain instances, a supplemental qualifier (SUPP -- ) variable might also contribute to the natural key of a record for a particular domain. See Section 4.1.9, Assigning Natural Keys in the Metadata , for how this should be represented, and for additional information on ke ys. Definitions A natural key is a set of data (1 or more columns of an entity) that uniquely identifies that entity and distinguishes it from any other row in the table. The advantage of natural keys is that they exist already; one does not need to introduce a new, “unnatural” value to the data schema. One of the difficulties in choosing a natural key is that just about any natural key one can think of has the potential to change. Because they have business meaning, natural keys are effectively coupled to the business, and they may ne ed to be reworked when business requirements change. An example of such a change in clinical trials data would be the addition of a position or location that becomes a key in a new study, but which was not collected in previous studies. A surrogate key is a single - part, artificially established identifier for a record. Surrogate key assignment is a special case of derived data, one where a portion of the primary key is derived. A surrogate key is immune to changes in business needs. In addition, the key dep ends on only 1 field, so it is compact. A common way of deriving surrogate key values is to assign integer values sequentially. The -- SEQ variable in the SDTM datasets is an example of a surrogate key for most datasets; in some instances, however, -- SEQ mi ght be a part of a natural key as a replacement for what might have been a key (e.g., a repeat sequence number) in the sponsor's database.",

Because general observation class data structures are fixed, sometimes information that might appear as columns in a more horizontal (denormalized) structure in presentations and reports will instead be represented as rows in an SDTM Findings structure. Because many different types of observations are all presented in the same structure, there is a need to provide additional metadata to describe expected properties that differentiate (e.g., he matology lab results from serum chemistry lab results in terms of data type, standard units, and other attributes). For example, the Vital Signs (VS) data domain could contain subject records related to diastolic and systolic blood pressure, height, weight , and body mass index (BMI).

For observations in Interventions or Events class domains, EPOCH should be based on the -- STDTC variable, since this is the start of the intervention or event. A possible, though unlikely, exception would be a finding based on an interval specimen collection that started in one epoch but ended in another. -- ENDTC might be a more appropriate basis for EPOCH in such a case. Sponsors should not impute EPOCH values, but should, where possible, assign EPOCH values on the basis of CRF instructions and structure, even if EPOCH was not directly collected and date/time data was not collected with sufficient precision to permit assig nment of an observation to an EPOCH on the basis of date/time data alone. If it is not possible to determine the epoch of an observation, then EPOCH should be null. Methods for assigning EPOCH values can be described in the Define - XML document. Because EPO CH is a study - design construct, it is not applicable to interventions or events that started before the subject's participation in a study, nor to findings performed before participation in a study. For such records, EPOCH should be null.

Expected variables may contain some null values, but in most cases will not contain null values for every record.

In some cases, sponsors may need to define new custom domains and may be concerned that CDISC domain codes defined in the future will conflict with those they choose to use. To eliminate any risk of a sponsor using a name that CDISC later determines to have a different meaning, domain codes beginning with the letters X, Y, and Z have been reserved for the creation of custom domains.

When a domain is split on -- CAT, -- CAT must not be null. • The Findings About (FA) domain (see Section 6.4.4, Findings About Events or In terventions ) may alternatively be split based on the domain of the value in -- OBJ. For example, FACM would store findings about Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) records. See Section 6.4.2, Naming Findings About Domai ns , for more details. The following rules must be adhered to when splitting a domain into separate datasets to ensure they can be appended back into 1 domain dataset: 1. The value of DOMAIN must be consistent across the separate datasets as it would have been if they had not been split (e.g., QS, FA). 2. All variables that require a domain prefix (e.g., -- TESTCD, -- LOC) must use the value of DOMAIN as the prefix value (e.g., QS, FA). 3. -- SEQ must be unique within USUBJID for all records across all the split datasets. If there are 1000 records for a USUBJID across the separate datasets, all 1000 records need unique values for -- SEQ.

When IDVAR is a value other than -- SEQ (e.g., -- GRPID, -- REFID, -- SPID), care should be used to ensure that the parent records across the split datasets have unique values for the variable specified in IDVAR, so that related children records do not acciden tally join back to incorrect parent records. 5. Permissible variables included in one split dataset need not be included in all split datasets. 6. For domains with 2 - letter domain codes (i.e., other than SUPPxx and RELREC), split dataset names can be up to 4 cha racters in length. For example, if splitting by -- CAT, dataset names would be the domain name plus up to 2 additional characters (e.g., QS36 for SF - 36).

In a case where a dataset includes a mix of records with different natural keys, the natural key that provides the most granularity is the one that sh ould be provided. The following example illustrates how to do this, and include a case where a Supplemental Qualifier variable is referenced because it forms part of the natural key. Musculoskeletal System Findings (MK) Domain Example Sponsor A chooses the following natural key for the MK domain: STUDYID, USUBJID, VISTNUM, MKTESTCD Sponsor B collects data in such a way that the location (MKLOC and MKLAT) and method (MKMETHOD) variables need to be included in the natural key to identify a unique row.

The important concept here is that a domain is not limited by physica l structure. A domain may comprise more than 1 physical dataset (e.g., the main domain dataset and its associated Supplemental Qualifiers dataset). Supplemental Qualifier variables should be referenced in the natural key by using a 2 - part name. The word QN AM must be used as the first part of the name to indicate that the contributing variable exists in a domain - specific SUPP -- ; the second part is the value of QNAM that ultimately becomes a column reference when the SUPPQUAL records are joined on to the main domain dataset (e.g., QNAM.XVAR when the SUPP -- record has a QNAM of \"XVAR\") . In this example, sponsor B might have collected data that used different imaging methods, using imaging devices with different makes and models, and using different hand positi ons.",

The natural key is then defined as follows: STUDYID, USUBJID, SPDEVID, VISITNUM, MKTESTCD, MKLOC, MKLAT, MKMETHOD, QNAM.MKHNDPOS where the notation \"QNAM.MKHNDPOS\" means the Supplemental Qualifier whose QNAM is \"MKHND POS\".This approach becomes very useful in a Findings domain when -- TESTCD values are \"generic\" and rely on other variables to completely describe the test. The use of generic test codes helps to create distinct lists of manageable controlled terminology fo r -- TESTCD. In studies where multiple repetitive tests or measurements are being made, for example in a rheumatoid arthritis study where repetitive measurements of bone erosion in the hands and wrists might be made using both X - ray and MRI equipment, the g eneric MKTEST \"Sharp/Genant Bone Erosion Score\" would be used in combination with other variables to fully identify the result. Taking just the phalanges, a sponsor might want to express the following in a test in order to make it unique: • Left or right han d • Phalangeal joint position (which finger, which joint) • Rotation of the hand • Method of measurement (x - ray or MRI) • Machine make and model When CDISC Controlled Terminology for a test is not available, and a sponsor creates -- TEST and -- TESTCD values, trying to encapsulate all information about a test within a unique value of a -- TESTCD is not a recommended approach for the following reasons: • It results in the creation of a potentially large number of test codes. • The 8 - character values of -- TESTCD become less intuitively meaningful. • Multiple test codes are essentially representing the same test or measurement simply to accommodate attributes of a test within the -- TESTCD value itself (e.g., to represent a body location at which a measurement was taken). As a result, the preferred approach would be to use a generic (or simple) test code that requires associated qualifier variables to fully express the test detail. This approach was used in creating the CDISC Controlled Terminology used in this example: The MKTE STCD value \"SGBESCR\" is a generic test code, and additional information about the test is provided by separate qualifier variables.",

Variables with names ending in \"CD\" are \"short\" versions of associated variables that do not include the \"CD\" suffix (e.g., -- TESTCD is the short version of -- TEST). Values of -- TESTCD must be limited to 8 characters and cannot start with a number, nor can they contain characters other than letters, numbers, or underscores. This is to avoid possible inco mpatibility with SAS v5 transport files. This limitation will be in effect until the use of other formats (e.g., Dataset - XML) becomes acceptable to regulatory authorities. Because QNAM serves the same purpose as -- TESTCD within supplemental qualifier datas ets, values of QNAM are subject to the same restrictions as values of -- TESTCD. Values of other \"CD\" variables are not subject to the same restrictions as -- TESTCD: • ETCD (the companion to ELEMENT) and TSPARMCD (the companion to TSPARM) are limited to 8 cha racters and do not have the character restrictions that apply to -- TESTCD. These values should be short for ease of use in programming, but it is not expected that they will need to serve as variable names. • ARMCD is limited to 20 characters and does not ha ve the character restrictions that apply to -- TESTCD. The maximum length of ARMCD is longer than for other \"short\" variables to accommodate the kind of values that are likely to be needed for crossover trials. For example, if ARMCD values for a 7 - period cr ossover were constructed using 2 - character abbreviations for each treatment and separating hyphens, the length of ARMCD values would be 20. This same rule applies to the ACTARMCD variable. Variable descriptive names (labels), up to 40 characters, should be provided as data variable labels for all variables, including Supplemental Qualifier variables. Use of variable names (other than domain prefixes), formats, decodes, terminology, and data types for the same type of data (even for custom domains and Supplemental Qualifiers) should be consistent within and across studies within a submission. 4.2.2 Two - character Domain Identifier In order to minimize the risk of difficulty when merging/joining domains for reporting purposes, the 2 - character domain identifier is used as a prefix in most variable names.",

The unique subject identifier (USUBJID) is required in all datasets containing subject - level data. USUBJID values must be unique for each trial participant (subject) across all trials in the submission. This means that no 2 or more subj ects, across all trials in the submission, may have the same USUBJID. In addition, the same person who participates in multiple clinical trials (when this is known) must be assigned the same USUBJID value in all trials. CDISC does not recommend any specifi c format for the values of USUBJID, only that the values need to be unique for all subjects in the submission, and across multiple submissions for the same compound. Many sponsors concatenate values for the study, site, and subject into USUBJID, but this i s not a requirement. It is acceptable to use any format for USUBJID, as long as the values are unique across all subjects. The following dm.xpt sample rows illustrate a single subject who participates in 2 studies, first in ACME01 and later in ACME14.

When values are used across domains, the meanings should be the same. Examples of where -- CAT/ -- SCAT may have meaning across domains/datasets include: a. Cases where different domains in the same general observation class contain similar conceptual information. A dverse Events (AE), Medical History (MH), and Clinical Events (CE), for example, are conceptually the same data, the only differences being when the event started relative to the study start and whether the event is considered a regulatory - reportable adver se event in the study.

Missing components are represented by right truncation or a hyphen (for intermediate components that are missing). If the date and time values are completely missing, the SDTM date field should be nul l. Every component except year is represented as 2 digits. Years are represented as 4 digits; for all other components, 1 - digit numbers are always padded with a leading zero. The following table provides examples of ISO 8601 representations of complete and truncated date/time values using ISO 8601 \"appropriate right truncations\" of incomplete date/time representations.

Duration is frequently used during a review; however, the duration timing variable ( -- DUR) should generally be used in a domain if it was collected in lieu of a start date/time ( -- STDTC) and end date/time ( -- ENDTC).

Clinical encounters are described by the CDISC visit variables. For planned visits, values of VISIT, VISITNUM, and VISITDY must be those defined in the Trial Visits (TV) dataset (see Section 7.3.1, Trial Visits ). For planned visits: • Values of VISITNUM are used for sorting and should, wherever possible, match the planned chronological order of visits. Occasionally, a protocol will define a planned visit whose timing is unpredictable (e.g., planned in response to an adverse event, a threshold test value, or a disease event), and completely chronological values of VISITNUM may not be possible in such cases. • There should be a one - to - one relationship between values of VISIT and VISITNUM. • For visits that may last more than 1 calendar day, VISITDY should be the planned day of the start of the visit. Sponsor practices for populating visit variables for unplanned visits may vary. • VISITNUM should generally be populated, even for unplanned visits, as it is expected in many Findings domains, as described above. The easiest method of populating VISITNUM for unplanned visits is to assign the same value (e.g., 99) to all unplanned visits, although this method provides no different iation between the unplanned visits and does not provide chronological sorting. Methods that provide a one - to - one relationship between visits and values of VISITNUM, that are consistent across domains, and that assign VISITNUM values that sort chronologica lly require more work and must be applied after all of a subject's unplanned visits are known. • VISIT may be left null or may be populated with a generic value (e.g., \"Unscheduled\") for all unplanned visits, or individual values may be assigned to different unplanned visits. • VISITDY must not be populated for unplanned visits; VISITDY is, by definition, the planned study day of visit.

The reason for the missing information may or may not have been collected. A sponsor has the following options: 1. Submit individual records for each test not done. 2. Submit 1 record for a group of tests that were not done. The following example illustrates the single - record approach for representing a group of tests not done.

      "content": "4.5.3.2 Text Strings Greater than 200 Characters in Other Variable s Some sponsors may collect data values longer than 200 characters for some variables. Because of the current requirement for the SAS V5 transport file format, it is not possible to store long text strings using only 1 variable. Therefore, the SDTMIG has d efined conventions for storing long text strings using multiple variables. For general observation - class variables and supplemental qualifiers (i.e., non - standard variables, NSVs), the conventions are as follows: • The first 200 characters of text should be stored in the parent domain variable and each additional 200 characters of text should be stored in a record in the SUPP -- dataset (see Section 8.4, Relating Non - standard Variable Values to a Parent Domain ). • When split ting a text string into several records, the text should be split between words to improve readability. • When the text longer than 200 characters is for a supplemental qualifier, the first QNAM should describe the NSV without any numeric suffix. • The value for QNAMs for additional text (>200 characters) should contain a sequential variable name, which is formed by appending a 1 - digit integer, beginning with 1, to the original domain variable name. • The value for QLABEL should be the original domain variable l abel. o The reason a digit integer or suffix is not appended to the label is because the long text string represents a single value for a variable. The physical representation (i.e., SAS V5 transport file format) does not change the concept described by the label. o This is different conceptually from when there are multiple values for a non - result qualifier variable and values are individually stored in SUPP -- . In that case, both QNAM and QLABEL must be uniquely named (see Section 4.2.8.3, Multiple Values for a Non - result Qualifier Variable ) because they represent multiple values for a single variable. o In cases where the standard domain variable name is already 8 characters in length, sponsors should replace the last chara cter with a digit when creating values for QNAM. As an example, for Other Action Taken in Adverse Events (AEACNOTH), values for QNAM for the SUPPAE records would have the values AEACNOT1, AEACNOT2, and so on.",

      "content": "4.5.8 Accounting for Long - term Follow - up Studies often include long - term follow - up assessments to monitor a subject's condition. Use cases include studies in terminally ill populations that periodically assess survival and studies involving chronic disease that include follow - up to assess relapse. Long - term follow - up is often conducted via telephone calls rather than clinic visits. Regardless of the method of contact, the information should be stored in the app ropriate topic - based domain. Overall study conclusion in the Disposition (DS) domain occurs once all contact with the subject ceases. If a study has a clinical treatment phase followed by a long - term follow - up phase, these 2 segments of the study can be re presented as separate epochs within the overall study, each with its own epoch disposition record. The following example illustrates the recommended SDTM approach to storing these data. An oncology study encompasses 2 months of clinical treatment and asses sments followed by once - monthly telephone contacts. The contacts continue until the subject dies. During the telephone contact, the investigator collects information on the subject's survival status and medication use. The answers to certain questions may trigger other data collection. For example, if the subject's survival status is \"dead\", then this indicates that the subject has ceased participation in the study, so a study discontinuation record would need to be created. In SDTM, the data related to the se follow - up telephone contacts should be stored as follows: 1. Concomitant medications reported during the contact should be stored in the CM domain. 2. The subject's survival status should be stored in the Subject Status (SS) domain. 3. The disposition of the sub ject at the time of the final follow - up contact should be stored in DS. Note that overall study conclusion is the point where any contact with the subject ceases, which in this example is also the conclusion of long - term follow - up. The disposition of the s ubject at the conclusion of the 2 - month clinical treatment phase would be stored in DS as the conclusion to that epoch. Long - term follow - up would be represented as a separate epoch. Therefore, in this example the subject could have 3 disposition records in DS, with both the follow - up epoch disposition and the overall study conclusion disposition being collected at the final telephone contact.",

Eve ry subject in a study must have a subject identifier (SUBJID). In some cases a subject may participate in more than 1 study. To identify a subject uniquely across all studies for all applications or submissions involving the product, a unique identifier (U SUBJID) must be included in all datasets. Subjects occasionally change sites during the course of a clinical trial. Sponsors must decide how to populate variables such as USUBJID, SUBJID and SITEID based on their operational and analysis needs, but only 1 DM record should be submitted for each subject. The Supplemental Qualifiers dataset may be used if appropriate to provide additional information. 3. Concerns for subject privacy suggest caution regarding the collection of variables like BRTHDTC. This variable is included in the Demographics model in the event that a sponsor intends to submit it; however, sponsors should follow regulatory guidelines and guidance as appropriate. 4.

If ARMNRS is populated with \"UNPLANNED TREATMENT\", ACTARMUD should be populated with a description of the unplanned treatme nt received. b. Multistage assignment to treatment: Some trials use a multistage process for assigning a subject to an arm (see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms , Example Trial 3). In such a case, best practice is to create ARMC D values composed of codes representing the results of the multiple stages of the treatment assignment process. If a subject is partially assigned, then truncated codes representing the stages completed can be used in ARMCD, and similar truncated codes can be used in ACTARMCD. The descriptions used to populate ARM and ACTARM should be similarly truncated, and the one - to - one relationship between these truncated codes should be maintained for all affected subjects in the trial. Example 3 below provides an exa mple of this situation; see also Section 5.3, Subject Elements , Example 2. Note that this use of values not in the TA dataset is allowable only for trials with multistage assignment to arms and to subjects in those tr ials who do not complete all stages of the assignment. c.

The order of these additional variables within the domain should follow the rules as described in Section 4.1.4, Order of the Variables , and the order described in Section 4.2, General Variable Assumptions . 9. As described in Section 4.1.4, Order of the Variables , RFSTDTC is used to calculate study day variables. RFSTDTC is usually defined as the date/time whe n a subject was first exposed to study drug. This definition applies for most interventional studies, when the start of treatment is the natural and preferred starting point for study day variables and thus the logical value for RFSTDTC. In such studies, w hen data are submitted for subjects who are ineligible for treatment (e.g., screen failures with ARMNRS = \"SCREEN FAILURE\"), subjects who were enrolled but not assigned to an arm (e.g., ARMNRS = \"NOT ASSIGNED\"), or subjects who were randomized but not trea ted (e.g., ARMNRS = \"NOT TREATED\"), RFSTDTC will be null. For studies with designs that include a substantial portion of subjects who are not expected to be treated, a different protocol milestone may be chosen as the starting point for study day variables . Some examples include non - interventional or observational studies, studies with a no - treatment arm, and studies where there is a delay between randomization and treatment. 10. The DM domain contains several pairs of reference period variables: RFSTDTC and RF ENDTC, RFXSTDTC and RFXENDTC, RFCSTDTC and RFCENDTC, and RFICDTC and RFPENDTC. There are 4 sets of reference variables to accommodate distinct reference - period definitions and there are instances CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights res erved Page 67 2021 - 11 - 29 when the values of the variables may be exactly the same, pa rticularly with RFSTDTC - RFENDTC and RFXSTDTC - RFXENDTC. a.

      "content": "However, there are certain study designs where the start of the r eference period is defined differently, such as studies that have a washout period before randomization or have a medical procedure required during screening (e.g., biopsy). In these cases, RFSTDTC may be the enrollment date, which is prior to first dose. Because study day values are calculated using RFSTDTC, in this case study days would not be based on the date of first dose. b. RFXSTDTC and RFXENDTC: This pair of variables defines a consistent reference period for all interventional studies and is not open to customization. RFXSTDTC and RFXENDTC always represent the date/time of first and last study exposure. The study reference period often duplicates the reference period defined in RFSTDTC and RFENDTC, but not always. Therefore, this pair of variables is important as they guarantee that a reviewer will always be able to reference the first and last study exposure reference period. RFXSTDTC should be the same as SESTDTC for the first treatment element described in the SE dataset. RFXENDTC may often be t he same as the SEENDTC for the last treatment element described in the SE dataset. c. RFCSTDTC and RFCENDTC: This pair of variables is used only when the study uses a protocol - specified challenge agent to induce a condition that the investigational treatment is intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent. RFCSTDTC and RFCENDTC always represent the date/time of first and last exposure to the challenge agent. d. RFICDTC and RFPENDTC: The definitions of this pair of variables are consistent in every study in which they are used: They represent the entire period of a subject’s involvement in a study, from providing informed consent through the last participation event or activity. There may be times when this period coincides with other reference periods but that is unusual. An example of when these periods might coincide with the study reference period, RFSTDTC to RFENDTC, might be an observational trial where no study intervention is administered. RFICDTC should correspond to the date of the informed consent protoc ol milestone in Disposition (DS), if that protocol milestone is documented in DS. In the event that there are multiple informed consents, this will be the date of the first. RFPENDTC will be the last date of participation for a subject for data included in a submission.",

      "content": "5.3 Subject Elements (SE) SE – Description/Overview A special - purpose domain that contains the actual order of elements followed by the subject, together with the start date/time and end date/time for each element. The Subject Elements dataset consolidates inf ormation about the timing of each subject’s progress through the epochs and elements of the trial. For elements that involve study treatments, the identification of which element the subject passed through (e.g., drug X vs. placebo) is likely to derive fro m data in the Exposure domain or another Interventions domain. The dates of a subject’s transition from one element to the next will be taken from t he Interventions domain(s) and from other relevant domains, according to the definitions (TESTRL values) in the Trial Elements (TE) dataset (see Section 7.2.2, Trial Elements ). The SE dataset is particularly useful for studies with multiple treatment periods, such as crossover studies. The SE dataset contains the date/times at which a subject moved from one element to another, so when this dataset, the Trial Arms (TA; see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms ) dataset, and the Trial Elements (TE; see Section 7.2.2, Trial Elements ) dataset are included in a submission, reviewers can relate all observations made abou t a subject to that subject’s progression through the trial. • Comparison of the -- DTC of a finding observation to the element transition dates (values of SESTDTC and SEENDTC) identifies which element the subject was in at the time of the finding. Similarly, one can determine the element during which an event or intervention started or ended. • “Day within Element” or “Day within Epoch” can be derived. Such variables relate an observation to the start of an element or epoch in the same way that study day ( -- DY) variables relate it to the reference start date (RFSTDTC) for the study as a whole. See Section 4.4.4, Use of the \"Study Day\" Variables . • Having knowledge of SE start and end dates can be helpful in the determination of baseline values.

      "content": "SE – Assumptions Submission of the SE dataset is strongly recommended, as it provides information needed by reviewers to plac e observations in context within the study. As noted in the SE - Description/Overview, the TE and TA datasets should also be submitted, as these define the design and the terms referenced by the SE dataset. The SE domain allows the submission of data on th e timing of the trial elements a subject actually passed through in their participation in the trial. Section 7.2.2, Trial Elements , and Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms , provide additi onal information on these datasets, which define a trial's planned elements and describe the planned sequences of elements for the arms of the trial. 1. For any particular subject, the dates in the SE table are the dates when the transition events identified in the TE table occurred. Judgment may be needed to match actual events in a subject's experience with the definitions of transition events (i.e., events that mark the start of new elements) in the TE table; actual events may vary from the plan. For instance, in a single - dose pharmacokinetics (PK) study, the transition events might correspond to study drug doses of 5 and 10 mg. If a subject actually received a dose of 7 mg when they were scheduled to receive 5 mg, a decision will have to be made on how to represent this in the SE domain. 2. If the date/time of a transition element was not collected directly, the method used to infer the element start date/time sho uld be explained in the Comments column of the Define - XML document. 3. Judgment will also h ave to be used in deciding how to represent a subject's experience if an element does not proceed or end as planned. For inst ance, the plan might identify a trial element that is to start with the first of a series of 5 daily doses and end after 1 week, wh en the subject transitions to the next treatment element. If the subject actually started the next treatment epoch (see Section 7.1, Introduction to Trial Design Model Datasets , and Section 7.1.2, Definitions of Trial Design Concepts ) after 4 weeks, the sponsor would have to decide whether to represent this as an abnormally long element, or as a normal element plus an unplanned non - treatment element.

The value of ETCD for an unplanned element is “UNPLAN” and SEUPDES should be populated with a description of the unplanned element. 5. The values of SESTDTC provide the chronological order of the actual subject elements. SESEQ should be assigned to be consiste nt with the chronological order. Note that the require ment that SESEQ be consistent with chronological order is more stringent than in most other domains, where - - SEQ values need only be unique within subject. 6. When TAETORD is included in the SE domain, it represents the planned order of an element in an arm. This should not be confused with the actual order of the elements, which will be represented by their chronological order and SESEQ. TAETORD will not be populated for su bject elements that are not planned for the arm to which the subject was assigned. Thus , TAETORD will not be populated for any element with an ETCD value of “UNPLAN”. TAETORD also will not be populated if a subject passed through an element that, although defined in the TE dataset, was out of place for the arm to which the subject was assign ed. For example, if a subject in a parallel study of drug A vs. drug B was assigned to receive drug A but received drug B instead, then TAETORD would be left blank for the SE record for their drug B element. If a subject was assigned to receive th e sequenc e of elements A, B, C, D, and instead received A, D, B, C, then the sponsor would have to decide for which of these SE records TAETORD should be populated. The rationale for this decision should be documented in the Comments column of the Define - XML docume nt. 7. For subjects who follow the planned sequence of elements for the arm to which they were assigned, the values of EPOCH in the SE domain will match those associated with the elements for the subject's arm in the TA dataset. The sponsor will have to decid e what value, if any, of EPOCH to assign SE records for unplanned elements and in other cases where the subject's actual elements deviate from the plan.

Note that SESTDTC is required, although -- STDTC is not r equired in any other subject - level dataset. The purpose of the dataset is to record the elements a subject actually passed through. If it is known that a subject passed through a particular element, then there mus t be some information (perhaps imprecise) o n when it started. Thus, SESTDTC may not be null, although some records may not have all the components (e.g., year, month, day, hour, minute) of the date/time value collected. 10. The following identifier variables are permissible and may be added as appropri ate: -- GRPID, -- REFID, -- SPID. 11. Care should be taken in adding additional timing variables: a. The purpose of -- DTC and -- DY is to record the date and study day on which data was collected. Elements are generally “derived” in the sense that they are a seconda ry use of data collected elsewhere; it is not generally useful to know when those date/times were recorded. b. -- DUR could be added only if the duration of an element was collected, not derived. c.

The Subject Visits domain consolidates information about the timing of subject visits that is otherwise spread over domains t hat include the visit variables (VISITNUM and possibly VISIT and/or VISITDY). Unless the beginning and end of each visit is collect ed, populating the SV dataset will involve derivations. In a simple case, where, for each subject visit, exactly 1 date appears in every such domain, the SV dataset can be created e asily by populating both SVSTDTC and SVENDTC with the single date for a vis it. When there are multiple dates and/or date/times for a visit for a particular subject, the derivation of values for SVSTDTC and SVENDTC may be more complex. The method for deriving these values should be consistent with the visit definitions in the Tria l Visits (TV) dataset (see Section 7.3.1, Trial Visits ). For some studies, a visit may be defined to correspond with a clinic visit that occurs within 1 day, whereas for other studies, a visit may reflect data collect ion over a multiday period. The SV dataset provides reviewers with a summary of a subject’s visits over the course of their participation in a study. Com parison of an individual subject’s SV dataset with the TV dataset, which describes the planned visits for the trial, supports the identification of planned but not expected vis its due to a subject not completing the study.

In general, data collection forms ar e prepared for particular visits, and the fact that data was co llected on a form labeled with a planned visit is sufficient to make the association. Occasionally, the association will not be so clear, and the sponsor will need to make decisions about how to label actual visits.

The variable SVCNTMOD is used to record the way in wh ich the visit was conducted. For example, for visits to a clinic, SVCNTMOD = \"IN PERSON\", visits conducted remotely might have values such as \"TELEPHONE\", \"REMOTE AUDIO VIDEO\", or \"IVRS\". If there are multi ple contact modes, refer to Section 4.2.8.3, Multiple Values for a Non - result Qualifier Variable . 8. The planned study day of visit variable (VISITDY) should not be populated for unplanned visits. 9. If SVSTDY is included, it is the actual study day corresponding to SVSTDTC . In studies for which VISITDY has been populated, it may be desirable to populate SVSTDY, as this will facilitate the comparison of planned (VISITDY) and actual (SVSTDY) study days for the start of a visit. 10. If SVENDY is included, it is the actual day corr esponding to SVENDTC. 11. For many studies, all visits are assumed to occur within 1 calendar day, and only 1 date is collected for the visit. In such a case, the values for SVENDTC duplicate values in SVSTDTC. However, if the data for a visit is actually coll ected over several physical visits and/or over several days, then SVSTDTC and SVENDTC should reflect this fact. Note that it is fairly common for screening data to be collected over seve ral days, but for the data to be treated as belonging to a single plan ned screening visit, even in studies for which all other visits are single - day visits. 12. Differentiating between planned and unplanned visits may be challenging if unplanned assessments (e.g., repeat labs) are perf ormed during the time period of a planned vi sit. 13. Algorithms for populating SVSTDTC and SVENDTC from the dates of assessments performed at a visit may be particularly challeng ing for screening visits, since baseline values collected at a screening visit are sometimes historical data from tests perfor med before the subject started screening for the trial. Therefore dates prior to informed consent are not part of the determination of SVSTDTC. 14.

The Exposure (EX) domain also seemed inappropriate; although the testing procedure might be part of the study plan, these dat a would not be used or analyzed in the same way as data about study treatments. The AG domain was created to fill this ga p. c. The AG domain has advantages over the Procedures (PR) domain for this purpose. It allows recording of multiple substance admi nistrations for a single testing procedure. It also separates data about substance administrations from data about procedures th at do not involve substance administration. d. Information about the conduct of the procedure with which the procedure agent administration was associated, if collected, sh ould be represented in the PR domain. 2. Examples and structure a. Examples of agents adminis tered as part of a procedure include a short - acting bronchodilator administered as part of a reversibility assessment and contrast agents or radio - labeled substances used in imaging studies.

The structure of the AG domain is 1 record per agent intervention episode, or prespecified agent assessment per subject. It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an intervention episode. This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for review and analysis. 3. AG description and coding a. AGTRT captures the name of the agent and it is the topic variable. It is a required variable and must have a value. AGTRT should include only th e agent name, and should not include dosage, formulation, or other qualifying information. For example, \"ALBUTEROL 2 PUFF\" is n ot a valid value for AGTRT. This example should be expressed as AGTRT = \"ALBUTEROL\", AGDOSE = \"2\", AGDOSU = \"PUFF\", and AGDOSFRM = \"AEROSOL\". b. AGMODIFY should be included if the sponsor's procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. c. AGDECOD is the standardized agent term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary. It is possible that the reported te rm (AGTRT) or the modified term (AGMODIFY) can be coded using a standard dictionary.",

A value of \"Y\" indicates that the agent was used and \"N\" indicates that it was not. c. If an agent was not prespecified, the value of AGOCCUR should be null. AGPRESP and AGOCCUR are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all agents were collected as free text. Values of AGOCCUR may also be null for prespecified agents if no Y/N response was collected; in this case, AGSTAT = \"NOT DONE\", and AGREASND could be used to describe the reason the answer was missing. 5. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or interventions general observation - class qualifiers may be added to the AG domain. a. However, -- INDC, although allowed, would not generally be used because substance administrations repre sented in AG are given as part of a testing procedure rather than with therapeutic intent. b. The variables -- DOSTOT and -- DOSRGM, although allowed, would generally not be used because procedure agents are likely to be recorded at the level of single adminis trations. AG – Examples Example 1 This example captures data about the allergen administered to the subject as part of a bronchial allergen challenge (BAC) tes t. Prior to the BAC, the subject had a skin - prick allergen test to help identify the allergen to be used for the BAC test. The skin - prick test identified grass as the allergen to be used in the BAC test. Data from the allergen skin test are not shown, but the CRF for the BAC includes collection of the allergen chosen for use in the BAC. A predetermined set of ascending doses of the chosen allergen was used in the screening BAC test. The results of the screening BAC are not shown, but would be represented in the Respiratory System Findings (RE) domain. Row 1: The first dose given in the BAC was saline. Rows 2 - 4: Three successively higher doses of grass allergen were given.

Then the procedure agent (AG domain) was given as part of a reversibility assessment. Spirometry measurements (RE do main) were obtained before and after agent administration. An identifier was a ssigned to the reversibility test and this identifier was used to be link data across the multiple SDTM domains in which the data are represented. The question as to whether a short - acting bronchodilator was administered in the 4 hours prior to the reversi bility assessment is represented in the CM domain because this prior administration would have been for therapeutic effect, not as part of the procedure. The question asked wa s about the administration of any short - acting bronchodilator, rather than a spec ific medication, so both CMTRT and CMCAT are populated with \"SHORT - ACTING BRONCHODILATOR\", which describes a group of medications.

CM – Assumptions 1. The structure of the CM domain is 1 record per medication intervention episode, constant - dosing interval, or prespecified medication assessment per subject. It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an intervention episode. This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for review and analysis. The submission dataset structure may differ from the structure used for collection. One common approach is to submi t a new record when there is a ch ange in the dosing regimen. Another approach is to collapse all records for a medication to a summary level with either a dos e range or the highest dose level. Other approaches may also be reasonable as long as they meet the sponsor's evaluation requiremen ts. 2. CM description and coding a. CMTRT is the topic variable and captures the name of the concomitant medication/therapy or the prespecified term used to coll ect information about the occurrence of any of a group of medications and/or therapies. It is a required variable and must have a value. CMTRT only includes the medication/therapy name and does not include dosage, formulation, or other qualifying information. For example, “ASPIRIN 100M G TABLET” is not a valid value for CMTRT. This example should be e xpressed as CMTRT= “ASPIRIN”, CMDOSE= “100”, CMDOSU= “MG”, and CMDOSFRM= “TABLET”. When referring to a prespecified group of medications/therapies, CMTRT contains the description of the gr oup used to solicit the occurrence response. b. CMMODIFY should be incl uded if the sponsor’s procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. c. CMDECOD is the standardized medication/therapy term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary. It is expected that th e reported term (CMTRT) or the modified term (C MMODIFY) will be coded using a standard dictionary. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define - XML document. d.

CMPRESP and CMOCCUR are used together to indicate whether the intervention in CMTRT was prespecified and whether it occurred, respectively.

CMOCCUR is used to indicate whether a prespecified medication was used. A value of \"Y\" indicates that the medication was used and \"N\" indicates that it was not. c. If a medication was not prespecified, the value of CMOCCUR should be null. CMPRES P and CMOCCUR are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all medications were collected as free text. Values of CMOCCUR may also be null for prespecified medications if no Y/N response was collected; in such cases, CMSTAT = \"NOT DONE\", a nd CMREASND could be used to describe the reason the answer was missing. 4. Variables for timing relative to a time point a. CMSTRTPT, CMSTTPT, CMENRTPT, and CMENTPT may be populated as necessary to indicate when a medication was used relative to specified time points. For example, assume a subject uses birth control medication. The subject has used the same medication for many years and continues to do so. The date the subject began using the medication (or at least a partial date) would be stored in CMSTDTC. CM ENDTC is null because the end date is unknown/has not yet happened. This fact can be recorded by setting CMENTPT = \"2007 - 04 - 30\" (the date the assessment was made) and CMENRTPT = \"ONGOING\". 5.

The EX domain is required for all studies that include protocol - specified study treatment.

The timing of exposure t o study treatment is captured by the start/end date and start/end time of each constant - dosing interval. If the subject is only exposed to study medication within a clinical encounter (e.g., if an injection is administered at the clinic), VISITNUM may b e a dded to the domain as an additional timing variable. VISITDY and VISIT would then also be permissible qualifiers. However, if the beginning and end of a constant - dosing interval is not confined within the time limits of a clinical encounter (e.g., if a sub ject takes pills at home), then it is not appropriate to include VISITNUM in the EX domain. This is because EX is designed to capture the timing of exposure to treatment, not the tim ing of dispensing treatment. Further, VISITNUM should not be used to indic ate that treatment began at a particular visit and continued for a period of time.

Perm 1 In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist valu es are enclosed in parentheses. EC – Assumptions 1. The EC domain model refle cts protocol - specified study treatment administrations, as collected. a. EC should be used in all cases where collected exposure information cannot or should not be directly represented in the Expos ure (EX) domain. For example, administrations collected in tablets when the protocol - specified unit is mg, or administrations collected in mL when the protocol - specified unit is mg/kg. Product accountability details (e.g., amount dispensed, amount returned) are represented in the DA domain, not in EC. b. Collected exposure data are in most cases represented in a combination of 1 or more of EC, DA, or Findings About Events or In terventions (FA) domains. If the entire EC dataset is an exact duplicate of the entire EX dataset, then EC is optional and at the sponsor's discretion. c. Collected exposure log data points descriptive of administrations typically reflect amounts at the product - level (e.g., number of tablets, number of mL). 2. Treatment description (ECTRT) is sponsor - defined and should reflect how the prot ocol - specified study treatment is known or referred to in data collection. In an open - label study, ECTRT should store the treatment name. In a masked study, if treatment is collected and known as tablet A to the subject or administrator, then ECTRT = \"TABL ET A\". If, in a masked study, the treatment is not known by a synonym and the data are to be exchanged between sponsors, partners, and/or regulatory agency(s), then assign ECTRT the value of \"MASKED\".",

All rights res erved Page 110 2021 - 11 - 29 b. Qualifier variables should be populated with equal granularity across s cheduled and performed records when known. For example, if ECDOSU and ECDOSFRQ are known at scheduling and administration, then the variables would be populated on both records. If ECLOC is deter mined at the time of administration, then it would be populat ed on the Performed record only. c. Appropriate timing variable(s) should be populated. Note: Details on Scheduled records may describe timing at a higher level than Performed records. d. ECOCCUR is generally not applicable for Scheduled records. e. An activity may be rescheduled or modified multiple times before being performed. Representation of Scheduled records is dependent on the collected, available data. If each rescheduled or modified activity is collected, then multiple Scheduled records may be repr esented. If only the final scheduled activity is collected, then it would be the only Scheduled record represented. 4. Doses not taken, not given, or missed a. The record qualifier -- OCCUR, with value of \"N\", is available in domains based on the Interventions and Events General Observation Classes as the standard way to represent whether an intervention or event did not happen. In the EC domain, ECOCCUR value of \"N\" indicat es a dose was not taken, not given, or missed. For example, if zero tablets are taken within a time frame or zero mL is infused at a visit, then ECOCCUR = \"N\" is the standard representation of the collected doses not taken, not given, or missed. Dose amount variables (e.g., ECDOSE, ECDOSTXT ) must not be set to zero (0) as an alternative method for indica ting doses not taken, not given, or missed. b. The population of qualifier variables (e.g., grouping, record) and additional timing variables (e.g., date of collection, vis it, time point) for records representing information collected about doses not taken, n ot given, or missed should be populated with equal granularity as administered records, when known and/or applicable.",

If a reason why a dose was not given is collected, it is represented in ECREASOC, the reason why ECOCCUR = \"N\". 5. Timing variables a. Timing variables i n the EC domain should reflect administrations by the intervals they were collected (e.g., constant - dosing intervals, visits, targeted dates like first dose, last dose). b. For administrations considered given at a point in time (e.g., oral tablet, pre - filled syringe injection), where only an administration date/time is collected, ECSTDTC should be copied to ECENDTC. 6. The degree of summarization of records from EC to EX is sponsor - defined to support study purpose and analysis. When the relationship between EC and EX records can be described in RELREC, then it should be defined. EX derivations must be described in the Define - XML document. 7. Additional interventions qualifiers a. -- DOSTOT is under evaluation for potential deprecation and replacement with a mechanism to describe total dose over any interval of time (e.g., day, week, month). Sponsors considering ECDOSTOT may want to consider using other dose amount variables (ECDOSE or ECDOSTXT) in combination with frequency (ECDOSFRQ) and timing variables to represent the data. b. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or findings general observation - class qualifiers may be added to the EC domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: -- STAT and -- REASND.

Endoscopic examinations (e.g., arthroscopy, diagnostic colonoscopy, therapeutic colonoscopy, diagnostic laparoscopy, therapeutic laparoscopy) c. Diagnostic tests (e.g., amniocentesis, biopsy, catheterization, cutaneous oximetry, finger stick, fluorophotometry, imaging t echniques (e.g., DXA scan, CT scan, MRI), phlebotomy, pulmonary function test, ski n test, stress test, tympanometry) d. Therapeutic procedures (e.g., ablation therapy, catheterization, cryotherapy, mechanical ventilation, phototherapy, radiation therapy/radiotherapy, thermotherapy) e. Surgical procedures (e.g., curative surgery, diagnostic su rgery, palliative surgery, therapeutic surgery, prophylactic surgery, resection, stenting, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, implantation) The Procedures domain is based on the Interventions observation class. The extent of physiological effect may range from observable to microscopic. Regardless of the extent of effect or whether it is collected in the study, all collected procedures are represented in this domain. The protocol design should specify whether procedure information will be collected.Measurements obtained from procedures are to be represented in their respective Findings domain(s). For example, a biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample that is then evaluated histopathological ly. In this case, details of the biopsy procedure can be repres ented in the PR domain and the histopathology findings in the Microscopic Findings (MI) domain. Describing the relationship between PR and MI records (in RELREC) in this example is dependent on whether the relationship is collected, eit her explicitly or im plicitly.",

At times, the test method overlaps with diagnostic/therapeutic procedures (e.g., ultrasound , MRI, x - ray) in - scope for the PR domain. The following is recommended: If timing (start, end or duration) or an indicator populating PROCCUR, PRSTAT, or PRREASND is colle cted, then a PR record should be created. If only the findings from a procedure are c ollected, then -- METHOD in the Findings domain(s) may be sufficient to reflect the procedure and a related PR record is optional. It is at the sponsor’s discretion whether to represent the procedure as both a test method ( -- METHOD) and related PR record. 3. P RINDC is used to represent a medical indication , a medical condition which makes a treatment advisable. The reason for a procedure may be something other than a medical indication. For example, an x - ray might be taken to determine whether a fracture was pr esent.

Additional categorization and grouping a. SUCAT and SUSCAT should not be redundant with the domain code or dictionary classification provided by SUDECOD, or with S UTRT. That is, they should provide a different means of defining or classifying SU records. For example, a sponsor may be interested in iden tifying all substances that the investigator feels might represent opium use, and to collect such use on a separate CRF page. This categorization might differ from the categorization derived from the coding dictionary. b. SUGRPID may be used to link (or associate) different records together to form a block of related records within SU at the sub ject level (see Section 4.2. 6, Grouping Variables and Categorization ). It should not be used in place of SUCAT or SUSCAT. 4. Timing variables a. SUSTDTC and SUENDTC may be populated as required. b.

Additional categorization and grouping a. AECAT and AESCAT should not be redundant with the domain code or dictionary classification provided by AEDECOD and AEBODSYS ( i.e., they should provide a different means of defining or classifying AE records). AECAT and AESCAT are intended for categorizations that are defined in advance. For example, a sponsor may have a CRF page for AEs of special interest and another page for all other AEs . AEC AT and AESCAT should not be used for after - the - fact categorizations such as \"clinically significant.\" In cases where a category of AEs of special interest resembles a part of the dictionary hierarchy (e.g., \"CARDIAC EVENTS\"), the categorization represented by AECAT and AESCAT may differ from the categorization derived from the coding dictionary. b.

Prespecified terms; presence or absence of events a. Adverse events are generally collected in 2 different ways, either by recording free text or using a prespecified list of ter m s.

Records for adv erse events that actually occurred should also exist in the AE dataset with AEPRESP set to “Y.” c. If a study collects both prespecified adverse events and free - text events, the value of AEPRESP should be “Y” for all prespecified events and null for events re ported as free text. AEPRESP is a permissible field and may be omitted from the dataset if all adverse events were collected as free text. d.

No other AE information was collected via general questions. The responses to the probing questions \"Ye s\", \"No\", or \"Not Done\" were represented in the FA domain (see Section 6.4, Findings About E vents or Interventions ).

The protocol specified that only 1 hip could be rep laced in a subject, and that subjects should be encouraged to begin walking within 2 days after surgery. This subject was walking on day 5 and tripped and sprained her left ankle. A few days later, she developed an infection in the hip bone adjacent to the implant. The implant was removed and replaced by a different produc t. She never regained full use of her hip, and was left with a limp. This example shows the use of the device - related variables indicating if the AE was unanticipated (AEUNANT), if it was related to the procedure that implanted the device rather than the d evice itself (AERLPRC), or if it was related to some other procedure or activity required by the protocol (AERLPRT). These ar e used to determine if the AE was an unanticipated serious device event, a designation required by some regulatory authorities.

The sensor attachment to the skin caused some skin irritation, which was considered to be caused by the device; the actio n taken was to reposition the device, and the subject recovered. Row 2: Shows an adverse event of infection at the sensor site. In the Microbiology Specimen (MB) domain (not shown), a record shows that the infection was caused by a microbe with partial res istance to common antibiotics, and so the subject was hospitalized to receive intravenous treatment. The event was considered to be prob ably related to the device, and was serious. The seriousness criteria included hospitalization, and the device - specific criterion of requiring intervention to prevent progression to life - threatening or fatal conditions (AESINTV).",

The BE domain contains data about actions taken that affect or may affec t a specimen, such as specimen collection, freezing and thawing, aliquoting, and transportation. This domain is intended to be applicable to any specimen tracking data, regardless of the reason for spec imen collection. 2. The value in BEREFID identifies the s pecimen most affected by the event. For aliquoting, this would be the child specimen(s) created by the event, rather than the parent specimen. BEREFID should not contain any identifiers other than specimen IDs. 3. BELOC holds the relevant anatomic location of the subject , so it should only be populated when the subject participates in and is directly affected by the event given in BETERM. 4. BEPARTY and BEPRTYID together identify the individual or organization that takes responsibility for the biospecimen as a result of the action in BETERM. For example, if BETERM is COLLECTED, BEPARTY would be a general term defining the type of responsible party, such as SITE, and BEPRTYID would contain the site identifier, such as 02. If BEPARTY is sufficient to uniquely identify the party (such as SPONSOR in a single - sponsor study), then BEPRTYID may be null. 5. Usually BEPARTY and BEPRTYID refer to who has possession of the biospecimen after the action in BETERM. In the cases where a biospecimen is lost or dest royed for example, BEPARTY and BEPRTYID may be null. 6. Timing variables: a. BESTDTC and BEENDTC hold the start and end date/times for the event given in BETERM. If the end date/time is the same as the start date/time for the event, then BEENDTC is null. b. Unlike other Events domains, BEDTC does not hold the date/time of data collection. Instead, it holds the date/time of specimen collection, in alignment with the use of -- DTC for specimen - related findings. BEDTC values for extracted or otherwise derived specimens are copied from that of the parent specimen.

CDISC/NCI codelist valu es are enclosed in parentheses. CE – Assumptions 1. The determination of events to be considered clinical events versus adverse events should be done carefully and with referenc e to regulatory guidelines or consultation with a regulatory review division. Events of clinical inte rest as defined by the protocol that are not considered AEs should be reflected as CEs. a. Events considered to be clinical events may include episodes of symptoms of the disease under study (often known as \"signs an d symptoms\"), or events that do not constit ute adverse events in themselves, though they might lead to the identification of an adverse event. For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for migraine headaches, migraine headaches may not be considered to be adverse events per pro tocol. The occurrence of migraines or associated signs and symptoms might be reported in CE. b. In vaccine trials, certain adverse events may be considered to be signs or symptoms and accordingly determined to be clinical events. If any event is considered serious, then the serious variable ( -- SER) and the serious adverse event flags ( -- SCAN, -- SCONG, -- SDTH, -- SHOSP, -- SDISAB, -- SLIFE, -- SOD, -- SMIE) would be required in the CE domain. c. Other studies might track the occurrence of specific events as efficacy endpoints . For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for prevention of ischemic stroke, all occurrences of TIA, stroke, and death might be captured as clinical events and assessed as to whether they meet endpoint criteria. Note that other information about these events may be reported in other datasets. For example, the event leading to death would be reported in AE; death would also be a reason for study discontinuation in the Disposition (DS) domain. 2. CEOCCUR and CEPRESP are used together to indicate whether the event in CETERM was prespecified and whether it occurred. CEPRESP can be used to separate records that correspond to probing questions for prespecified events from those that represent spontaneously reported events, whereas CEOCCUR contains the responses to such questions.",

Timing variables a. Relative timing assessments \"Prior\" or “Ongoing” are common in the collection of CE information. CESTRF or CEENRF may be used when this timing assessment is relative to the study reference period for the subject represented in the Demographics (DM) dataset (RFENDTC). CESTRTPT with CESTTPT and/or CEENRTPT with CEENTPT may be used when \"Prior\" or \"Ongoing\" are relative to specific dates other than the start and end of the study reference period. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables . b. Additional timing variables may be used when appropriate. 6. The clinical events domain is based on the Events general observation class and thus can use any variables in the Events class, including those found in the AE domain spe cification table. CE – Examples Example 1 In this example, data were collected about prespecified events that, in the context of this study, were not reportable as AEs. The data were c ollected in a log independent of visits, rather than in visit - based CRF modules, so visit and date of collection (CEDTC) data were not collected.

The Disposition (DS) dataset provides an accounting for all subjects who entered the study and may include protocol milestone s, such as randomization, as well as the subject's completion status or reason for discontinuation for the entire study or each phase or segment of the study, including screening and post - treatment follow - up. Sponsors may choose which disposition events and milestones to submit for a study. See ICH E3, Section 10.1, for information about disposition events. 2. Categorization a. DSCAT is used to distinguish between disposition events, protocol milestones, and other events. The controlled terminology fo r DSCAT consists of \"DISPOSITION EVENT\", \"PROTOCOL MILESTONE\", and \"OTHER EVENT\". b. An event with DSCAT = “DISPOSITION EVENT” describes either disposition of study participation or of a study treatment. It describes whether a subject completed study participation or a study treatment and, if not, the reason they did not complete it. Dispositions may b e described for each epoch (e.g., screening, initial treatment, washout, cross - over treatment, follow - up) or for the study as a whole. If disposition events for both study participation and study treatment(s) are to be represented, then DSSCAT provides thi s distinction.",

DSSCAT may be used when DSCAT = \"PROTOCOL MILESTONE\" or \"OTHER EVENT\", but would be subject to additional CDISC Controlled Terminology. d. An event with DSCAT = “PROTOCOL MILESTONE” is a protocol - specifi ed, point - in - time event. Common protocol milestones include “INFORMED CONSENT OBTAINED” and “RANDOMIZED.” DSSCAT may be used for subcategories of protocol milestones. e. An event with DSCAT = \"OTHER EVENT\" is another important event that occurred during a tri al, but was not driven by protocol requirements and was not captured in another Events or Interventions class dataset. “TREATMENT UNBLINDED” is an example of an event that w ould be represented with DSCAT = “OTHER EVENT”.

If no reason was collected, then DSTERM should be populated with the value in DSDECOD. 4. Timing variables a. DSSTDTC is expected and is used for th e date/time of the disposition event. Events represented in the DS domain do not have end dates; disposition events do not span an interval, but rather occur at a single date/time (e.g., randomization date, disposition of study participation or study treat ment). b. DSSTDTC documents the date/time that a protocol milestone, disposition event, or other event occurred. For an event with DSCA T = \"DISPOSITION EVENT\" where DSTERM is not \"COMPLETED\", the reason for non - completion may be related to an observation repo rted in another dataset. DSSTDTC is the date/time that the Epoch was completed and is not necessarily the same as the date/time, star t date/time, or end date/time of the observation that led to discontinuation. For example, a subject reported severe verti go on June 1, 2006 (AESTDTC). After ruling out other possible causes, the investigator decided to discontinue study treatment on June 6, 2006 (DSSTDTC). The subject reported that the vertigo had resolved on June 8, 2006 (AE ENDTC). c. EPOCH may be included as a timing variable as in other general observation - class domains. In DS, EPOCH is based on DSSTDTC. The values of EPOCH are drawn from the Trial Arms (TA) dataset (see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms ). 5. Reasons for terminatio n: ICH E3 Section 10.1 indicates that “the specific reason for discontinuation” should be presented, and that summaries shoul d be “grouped by treatment and by major reason.” The CDISC SDS Team interprets this guidance as requiring 1 standardized dispositi o n term (DSDECOD) per disposition event. If multiple reasons are reported, the sponsor should identify a primary reason and use that to populat e DSTERM and DSDECOD. Additional reasons should be submitted in SUPPDS.

EPOCH was taken from the CRF, which asked about completion of each epoch of the stu dy. Data about disposition of study treatment was not collected, but the sponsor populated DSSCAT with \"STUDY PARTICIPATION\" to emphasize that these represent di sposition of study participation. Data were also collected about several protocol milestones re presented with DSCAT = \"PROTOCOL MILESTONE\". Rows 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18: Show records for protocol milestones. DSTERM and DSDECOD are populated with the same value, the name of the milestone. Note that for randomization events, EPOCH = \"SCREENING\", because randomization occurred before the start of treatment, during the screening epoch. Rows 3 - 5: Show 3 records for a subject who completed 3 stages of the study (\"SCREENING\", \"TREATMENT\", \"FOLLOW - UP\"). Row 7: Shows disposition of a subject who was a s creen failure. The verbatim reason the subject was a screen failure is represented in DSTERM. Because the subject did not complete the screening epoch, DSDECOD is not “COMPLETED” but another appropriate controlled term, \"PROTOCOL VIOLATION\". The date of di scontinuation is in DSSTDTC. The protocol deviation event itself would be represented in the DV dataset. Rows 10 - 11: Show disposition of a subject who completed the screening stage but did not complete the treatment stage.

MHEVDTYP is a domain - specific variable that can be used to indicate the aspect of the event that is represented in the event start and/or end date/times (MHSTDTC and/or MHENDTC). If a start date and/or end date is collected without further specification of what const itutes the start or end of the event, then MHEVDTYP is not needed. However, when data collection specif ies how the start or end date is to be reported, MHEVDTYP can be used to provide this information. For example, when collecting the date of diagnosis, it would be used to pop ulate MHSTDTC; MHEVDTYP would be populated with \"DIAGNOSIS\". If MHEVDTYP is not ne eded for any collected data, it need not be included in the dataset. If MHEVDTYP is included in the dataset, it should be populated only when the data collection specifies the as pect of the event that is to be used to populate the start and/or end date; ot herwise, it should be null. b. When data collected about an event includes 2 different dates that could be considered the start or end of an event, then an MH record will be created for each. For example, if data collection included both a date of onset of s ymptoms and a date of diagnosis, there would be 2 records for the event, one with MHSTDTC the date of onset of symptoms and MHEVDTYP = \"SYMPTOMS\" and a second with MHSTDTC the date of diagnos is and MHENDTYP = \"DIAGNOSIS\". In such a case, it is recommended that the 2 records be linked by means such as a common value of MHSPID or MHGRPID. 7. Any identifiers, timing variables, or Events general observation - class qualifiers may be added to the MH domain, but the following Qualifiers would generally not be used: -- SER, -- ACN, -- ACNOTH, -- REL, -- RELNST, -- OUT, -- SCAN, -- SCONG, -- SDISAB, ‑‑ SDTH, -- SHOSP, -- SLIFE, -- SOD, -- SMIE.

The DV domain is an Events model for collected protocol deviations and not for derived protocol deviations that are more likely to be part of analysis. Events typically include what the event was, captured in -- TERM (the topic variable), and when it happened (captured in its start and/or end dates). The intent of the domain model is to capture protocol deviations that occurred during the course of the study (see ICH E3, Sectio n 10.2[1]). Usually these are deviations that occur after the subject has been randomized or received the first tr eatment. 2. This domain should not be used to collect entry - criteria information. Violated inclusion/exclusion criteria are stored in IE. The Deviations domain is for more general deviation data. A protocol may indicate that violating an inclusion/exclusion c riterion during the course of the study (after first dose) is a protocol violation. In this case, this information would go into DV. 3.

If so, these may be separated into primary and secondary causes and/or other appropr iate designations. DD may also include other details about the death, such as where t he death occurred and whether it was witnessed. 2. Death details are typically collected on designated CRF pages. The DD domain is not intended to collate data that are collect ed in standard variables in other domains, such as AE.AEOUT (Outcome of Adverse Eve nt), AE.AESDTH (Results in Death) or DS.DSTERM (Reported Term for the Disposition Event). Data from other domains that relates to the death can be linked to DD using RELREC. 3. This domain is not intended to include data obtained from autopsy. An autopsy is a procedure from which there will usually be findings. Autopsy information should be handled as per recommendations in the Procedures (PR) domain . 4. There are separate codelists for DD tests and responses. Associations between the DD tests and response codeli sts are described in the DD codetable (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled - terminology ). 5.

The CP domain is modeled for use with disseminated tissue specimens (e.g., blood and other body fluids, bone marrow aspirates) and cell suspensions, and is not cur rently modeled for evaluations of solid tissue specimens. The domain is intended to support tests associated with a cell pheno typing component based on the use of markers and is not intended for tests that are not associated with marker - based phenotyping, which are more appropriate to include in another domain (e.g., Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments (IS), Laboratory Test Resu l ts (LB), Microscopic Findings (MI)). The CP domain is not intended to supplant use of the LB domain for routine lab hematology (e.g., blood cell differentials), nor is it intended for findings originating from microscopic assessment of cells, including tho se employing immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. The modeled use cases include measurement of • cell populations identified, classified, and/or otherwise characterized based on the differential expression of phenotypic an d/or cell state/function markers, a s determined for both normal and abnormal cell populations; • the level of marker expression; • substances interacting with (e.g., binding to) a marker which is a target of interest (not limited to a pharmacologic target) ; and • other cell properties based on ch aracterization of expression marker(s) and/or substances that interact with the marker(s). To provide the flexibility needed to report cell marker expression data, which can range widely in complexity, several new SD TM variables have been created. Most of the new variables are permissible, and are available as needed to fully define a test and/or to prevent ambiguity that could lead to misunderstanding or difficulty in i nterpreting the data. New variables include -- SBMRKS (Sublineage Marker String), -- CELST A (Cell State), -- CSMRKS (Cell State Marker String), -- TSTCND (Test Condition), -- CNDAGT (Test Condition Agent), -- BNDAGT (Binding Agent), -- ABCLID (Antibody Clone Identifier), -- MRKSTR (Marker String), -- GATE (Gate Name), -- GATEDEF (Gate Definition), -- SP TSTD (Sponsor Test Description), -- TSTPNL (Test Panel), -- RESSCL (Result Scale), and -- RESTYP (Result Type).",

All rights res erved Page 200 2021 - 11 - 29 Sponsors that previously chose to submit cell phenotyping data in the LB domain, where LBTEST was often used to populate cell marker information (e.g., \"CD4\" to indicate helper T lymphocytes), should note that the new variable -- MRKSTR should be used to house the full marker string information used to define the test in terms of markers; the -- TEST variable is reserved for the name of the cell population. Several of the ne w variables (i.e., -- SBMRKS, -- CELSTA, -- CSMRKS) are used to further subdivide the population reported in -- TEST into more granular unnamed subpopulations based on 1 or more additional markers. This approach provides a more easily understood test name in t he -- TEST variable and enables development of controlled terminology for -- TEST and -- TESTCD. The goal is to standardize, where possible, cell phenotype test names across studies so that it will be easier for us ers to understand and interpret the data (e.g ., when different marker sets are used across labs to define the same cell population). This approach also enhances the abili ty to integrate and compare data across studies in a practicable manner that (in addition to being less error - prone) preserves the often subtle differences between tests, which are essential for determining whether tests are truly comparable. Used in accordance with this guidance, the complete marker sting information provided in the -- MRKSTR variable reflects the operational (i.e., l aboratory - specific) definition of the test measurement. Together with the gating information provided in the -- GATE and -- GATEDEF variables, -- MRKSTR values help to ensure that proper groupings and comparisons are made across tests by preserving nuanced de tails that may affect the interpretation of test results.",

Perm CPCSMRKS Cell State Marker Stri ng Char Variable Qualifier Identifies the marker(s) or indicator(s) used to define the cell state (i.e., the value in CPCELSTA). For example, when Ki67 expression is used to determine that a cell population is in a proliferating state (i.e., CPCELSTA valu e=\"PROLIFERATING\"), the value \"Ki67+\" in CPCSMRKS indicates that positive expression of Ki67 was used to define the population as proliferating. Similarly, a value of \"Ki67 - \" in CPCSMRKS would indicate that lack of expression of Ki67 defined the \"NON - PROLI FERATING\" cell state in CPCELSTA. The CPCSMRKS value is useful for quickly determining which marker(s) were used to classify (i.e., operationally define) a cell population based on a functional/biological state.

A value which is calculated and reported by a lab according to its pr ocedures is considered collected rather than derived; the Derived Flag (CPDRVFL) should be null for these results. 4. CPCELSTA is used in conjunction with CPSCMRKS. When CPCELSTA is populated, CPSCMRKS must also be populated. Conversely, when CPSCMRKS is populated, CPCELSTA must be populated. 5. The combination of values in CPTEST, CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, and CPCSMRKS are used to uniquely identify a test. When 1 or more of the variables CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, or CPCSMRKS are populated, the Test Name (CPTEST) must be populated with the test name variant containing the \"Sub\" suffix to indicate that the finding/result pertains to a subpopulation of the cell type named in CPTEST. 6. Populating the CPTEST and CPMRKSTR variables: The general structure of CPTEST depends on th e use case (e.g., immunophenotyping, quantitative marker expression, target/receptor occupancy), which is generally conveyed by the CPCAT and/or CPSCAT value(s). Currently, CP supports the following use cases for which guidance on CPTEST and CPMRKSTR value s are given: a. Immunophenotyping i. CPTEST is populated with the name of the cell type being measured, not with the set of markers used to define the cell type. ii. It is expected that CPMRKSTR is populated, and that it contains the entire set of markers used to d efine the test, including those that are also present in CPSBMRKS and/or CPCSMRKS. iii. Marker strings follow, as closely as possible, formatting recommendations presented in assumption 8. b. Quantitative single - marker expression i. CPTEST begins with the identity of the marker (e.g., CD99), followed by the word \"Expression\" (e.g., \"CD99 Expression\"). ii. It is expected that CPMRKSTR is populated, and that it starts by identifying the marker being quantified (e.g. \"CD99\").

Because the majority of cell phenotyping tests of interest are for viable cells, the word \"Viable\" is not generally included in the test name (CPTEST) and usually does not need to be explicitly stated in CPCELSTA. Because populating CPCELSTA and CSMRKS with viability information necessitates appending the \"Sub\" suffi x to the value in CPTEST (assumption 5), it is recommended that CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS generally not be used unless a selective viability stain was included in the test in order to differentiate the record for viable cells from record(s) for cells in a diff erent vital state. For example, when viable cells are being compared to apoptotic and/or non - viable cells, it is necessary to differentiate those records using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS. In such cases where CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS are populated, the \"Sub\" suffix is appended to the value in CPTEST (assumption 5).",

For example, if the value in CPGATE is \"Lymphocytes, Viable\" and 7AAD - was used to define the viable state, 7AAD - is included in CPGATDEF, in addition to being included in the complete marker string in CPMRKSTR. 8. Recommended formatting of marker string variables CPMRKSTR, CPSBMRKS, and CPCSMRKS: The marker string variables provide critical information for defining a test. Although there are no current plans to control their values through CDISC Controlled Terminology codelists, adherence to the following formatting guidelines helps to preclude ambiguities that can lead to uncertainty in uniquely understanding a test and its associated result. a. Marker strings do not contain delimiting characters (e.g., \",\", space, \"/\", \"|\") to separate individual markers within the string, nor do they contain punctuation (e.g., hyphens) within individual markers, as these can be confused with symbols used to designate levels of expression and /or make it difficult to distinguish between the individual markers that comprise the string. For example, although the scientific literature often uses \"HLA - DR\", this is represented in CP marker strings as \"HLADR\". b. Forward slash \"/\" is only used to separ ate the portion of the marker string defining a numerator from the portion defining a denominator. c. When referring to a marker using the cluster of differentiation (CD) designation, \"CD\" should be included as part of the marker reference. For example, a marker string for helper T lymphocytes comprising CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD8 markers would be \"CD45+CD3+CD4+CD8 - \" (rather than \"45+3+4+8 - \"). d. The order of markers within a string is consistent across similar tests, generally proceeding in the order that defines the cell hierarchy from highest to lowest, followed by additional non - lineage - defining markers, and ending with cell state and viability markers. This order maintains alignment with how a test is identified using the ordered combination of CPT EST, CPSMRKS, and CPCELSTA.",

Indicating the expression level of individual markers included in a marker string: A variety of formats are used in the scientific literature for indicating the level of expression of a marker on or within a cell. For example, after identifying a marker such as CD4, its level of expression might be represented as 1 of the following: i. ne g, min, or - to denote the absence or minimal expression (e.g., CD4neg, CD4min, CD4 - ) ii. pos or + to denote that the marker is expressed (e.g., CD4pos, CD4+) iii. high, hi, or ++ to denote that the marker is expressed at a very high level relative to simply being \"positive\" (e.g., CD4high, CD4hi, CD4++) iv. other formats (e.g., - /low, - /lo, low, lo, mid, - /+, +++) g. Because categories for expression levels are subjective in the sense that they are relative to one another, various formats often overlap, which can cr eate ambiguities. Some degree of consistency in formats used to represent relative expression levels is warranted to mitigate ambiguity, at least to the extent that relative expression levels used to define cell lineages/sublineages are similar across stud ies and laboratories in order to enable comparisons. Five designations are recommended for use in SDTM datasets: i. \" - \" (the marker is not expressed; at times, the use of \" - lo\" may be justified to indicate that the marker is either not expressed or is present in a negligible amount) ii. \"lo\" (the marker is expressed at a low level) iii. \"mid\" (the marker is expressed somewhere between a low and \"normal\" positive level for that cell type) iv. \"+\" (the marker is expressed at a normal positive level for that cell type) v. \"hi\" ( the marker is expressed at a distinctly higher level than in cells that are \"+\", such that they are distinguishable from the \"+\" population and define their own subpopulation) vi. Although these designations are expected to be useful in the majority of cases, it is recognized that designations not listed here may be more appropriate in some cases. The data provider must determine the best way to designate an expression level suited to the purpose of the test, while striving to mitigate ambiguities resulting fro m lack of consistency of use.",

Explicitly indicating the cellular sublocation for a marker: In most cases, the location of a marker on or within a cell is not necessary; however, there are situations in which a marker can be expressed in more than a single cellular compartment and there is a need for the test to distinguish between marker expression in one compartment versus another. To accommodate this, using a lowercase letter in front of the marker is recommended. The cell sublocations are usually related to the cell surface (plasma membrane), cytoplasm, and nucleus. Use m , c , or n in front of the marker to denote \"membrane\", \"cytoplasm\", and \"nucleus\", respectively. An example of a marker often associated with a need to indicate cell location is CD152 (CT LA4), where cytoplasmic expression may define a test to distinguish it from whole cell expression. In this case, \"cCD152\" is used to denote that it is the cytoplasmic expression of CD152 that is measured for the test.

CPNRIND can be added to indicate where a result falls with respect to a reference range defined by CPORNRLO and CPORNRHI (e.g., \"HIGH\", \"LOW\"). 10. The variable CPORRESU uses the UNIT codelist. This means that sponsors should be submitting a term from the CDISC Submission Value column in the publi shed Controlled Terminology maintained for CDISC by NCI EVS. When sponsors have units that are not in this column, they should first check to see if their unit is mathematically synonymous with an existing unit and submit their lab values using that unit. If this is not the case, then a request for a new term (see https://ncitermform.nci.nih.gov/ ) should be submitted. CP – Examples The CP domain includes use of several new qualifier variables. The primary intent of the following examples is to demonstrate the appropriate use of these new variables based on a selection of use cases for which they would ordinarily be included in a well - structured CP dataset. Secondarily, the examples il lustrate standardized formatting concepts for variables that are not associated with a formal Controlled Terminology codelist. Although not controlled, the standardized formatting of content for these variables significantly aids understanding of the test and associated data, making data review and comparisons much easier.",

The following new SDTM variables are included in the examples: CPSBMRKS (Sublineage Marker String), CPCELSTA (Cell State), CPCSMRKS (Cell State Marker String), CPTSTCND (Test Condition), CPCNDAGT (Test Condition Agent), CPBDAGNT (Binding Agent), CPABCLID (Antibody Clone Identifier), CPMRKSTR (Marker String), CPGATE (Gate), CPGATDEF (Gate Definition), CPSPTSTD (Sponsor Test Description), CPTSTPNL (Test Panel), CPRESSCL (Result Scale), CPRESTYP (Result Type), and CPCOLSRT (Collected Summary Result Type). The proper use of each of these variables is illustrated in 1 or more of the examples, based on the identified use case. Example 1 Example 1a illustrates use of the CPMRKSTR variable for an assay panel that enumerates several of the major named cell subpopulations of leukocytes. For most cases involving simple phenotyping, and when used in accordance with CP domain guidance, the CPMRKSTR variable is sufficient for providing the marker information needed to fully describe a test. As su ch, CPMRKSTR is the only new CP test qualifier variable having a Core designation of \"Expected\". In such a case, the sponsor may determine whether to include other permissible CP test qualifier variables, based on the needs of the data recipient. This exam ple presents records that might typically be reported for a panel of tests quantifying T - cell, B - cell, monocyte, and natural killer (NK) cell populations, and for subtyping T - cells. In this example, the sponsor determined that none of the permissible CP te st qualifier variables were needed to accurately comprehend or distinguish among tests in the dataset, so chose to include only the CPMRKSTR (complete markers string) information. Example 1b, in addition to including the expected CPMRKSTR variable, introdu ces 2 additional variables: CPGATE and CPGATDEF. These variables convey gating information used in data collection and/or analyses, and are often needed to fully understand a test. Typically, either the full gating strategy or the penultimate gate is ident ified. Because different gating strategies for the same test can yield somewhat different test results, the CPGATE and CPGATDEF variables provide the means for transmitting this information at the test (i.e., record) level.",

A lthough in most cases only viable cells are measured in a test, making it unnecessary to specifically indicate their viabilit y status in the dataset, there are other situations (e.g., when the ratio of viable to non - viable cells is of particular interest) when each cell state needs to be explicitly indicated in order to differentiate the tests. The principles illus trated in the example using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS variables also apply to more complex tests where the biological state of the cell population is considered to be integral to the test. Rows 1 - 2: Forward light scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) are almost always applied as the first gating parameters to distinguish si nglets and viable cells from doublets and debris. In row 1, a lymphocyte (LYM) co unt is reported which does not explicitly provide viability information. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that FSC SSC g ating is applied to exclude doublets, debris, and dead cells. Secondary FSC and SSC gating is then used to distinguish the lymphocy te population from other CD45+ leukocytes. In contrast, row 2 explicitly calls out cell viability based on the use of viabili ty marker 7AAD to exclude cells that are in the process of dying (7AAD+). This is indicated in the Marker String (CPMRKSTR) and Gat e Definition (CPGATEDEF) variables. In addition, the term \"VIABLE\" is included in the gate name (CPGATE).

Rows 5 - 6: Illustrate using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS for the apoptotic cell state. The sponsor is reporting the apoptotic lymphocyte subpop ulati on, both as a cell count (row 5) and as a percentage of total lymphocytes (row 6). The apoptotic cell state in CPCELSTA is defined as cells that are ANXV+ in CPCSMRKS. As in rows 3 and 4, the suffix \"Sub\" is added to the value in CPTEST to indicate that it is a subpopulation of lymphocytes (i.e., apoptotic) being measured. Rows 7 - 8: Illustrate using CPTEST, CPCELSTA, and CPCSMRKS variables to present findings when the cell population has more than a single cell state of interest (e.g., both viable and apopt otic). In this case, viability marker 7AAD is used in combination with apoptosis marker ANXV. Rows 9 - 11: Illustrate a need to pre - coordinate information into the test name when the test incorporates results from two or more records (e.g., a ratio) in whic h key component(s) of the test are split across multiple variables.

Because the ratio in row 11 is based on counts of both the viable (row 9) and the non - viable (row 10) lymphocyte subpopulations, it is not appropriate to use the CPCELSTA variable. Instead, the viability information is pre - coordinated into the value in CPTEST. Additionally, because the cell state (i.e., \"VIABLE\" or \"NON - VIABLE\") is pre - coordinated into the Test Name in row 11, the suffix \"Sub\" is no longer need ed in CPTEST (i.e., the Test Name is \"Lymphocytes Viable/Lymphocytes NonViable\" rather than \"Lymphocytes Sub Viable/Lymphocyt es Sub NonViable\".

CPTEST is used to identify named cell populations (i.e., those cell types assigned names established by the scientific c ommunity). However, simply naming a cell type in CPTEST is often not sufficient for identifying or distinguishing among further subpopulations within that named population. In those cases, CPTEST alone does no t contain the full complement of information ne eded to accurately define a test. For example, a test might be specific for a cell population existing in a certain state (e.g., activated, proliferating, apoptoti c). Moreover, named populations can often be subdivided into sublineages which have not been assigned names; these may only be distinguishable by including the 1 or more additional markers used to define the sublineage. To accommodate the need for further subsetting, 3 new variables that qualif y CPTEST have been added to the CP domain specificatio n for use when needed. Two of the variables, CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS, support identifying a cell state. The third variable, CPS BMRKS, supports identifying additional markers needed to subdivide the named population in CPTEST into further sublineages. In orde r to make it clear that 1 or more of these variables have been used to further subdivide CPTEST, the value of the named cell population in CPTEST is ap pended with \"Sub\" to denote that the true test is a subset, subpopulation, or sublineage of the parent po pulation identified in CPTEST.",

      "content": "When considering the need to use the CPSBMRKS variable, it is important to note that CPTEST is populated with the hierarchica lly lowest (most granular) named population, to which \"Sub\" is then appended. This ensures that CPSB MRKS contains only those additional marker(s) required to further differentiate subset(s) within the named population identif ied in CPTEST. For example, if 2 additional markers, CDxx and CDyy, are used to further classify T lymphocyte helper 2 cells into C Dxx+CDyy - and CDxx - CDyy+ sublineages, CPTEST would contain the most granular named population (TLymHelp 2) appended with \"Sub\" in each of the 2 records (i.e., \"TLym Help 2 Sub\"), and CPSBMRKS would contain \"CDxx+CDyy - \" in 1 of the records and \"CDxx - CDyy+\" in the other. Rows 1 - 3: Show use of CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS to further subset the named cell population in CPTEST. In row 1, the total monocyte populat ion, based on expression of CD14, is measured without any further subsetting. Rows 2 and 3 show that the mo nocyte population is further subdivided, based on the cell state, into \"proliferating\" and \"non - proliferating\" subpopulations as indicated by the CPCELSTA value. The value \"Monocytes\" in CPTEST for these rows is appended with \"Sub\" to \"Monocytes Sub\" to in dicate that the record pertains to a subpopulation of monocytes (i.e., proliferating or non - proliferating). CPCELSTA is used to indicate that row 2 contains data for the proliferating subpopulation and row 3 contains data for the non - proliferating subpopul ation. The CPCSMRKS variable is used to indicate that positive expression of the Ki67 marker (i.e., Ki67+) is used to identify the proliferating subpopulation and cells that do not express the Ki67 marker (i.e., Ki67 - ) is used to identify the non - prolifera ting subpopulation.

CPMRKSTR contains the full marker string for each side of the ratio. CPGRPID is used to indicate which grouping of related records are used to perform the calc ulation. In the example, the lab did not provide \"RATIO\" as a unit of measure for the test and the sponsor chose not to inclu de \"RATIO\" in CPORRESU and CPSTRESU, but did include it as the Result Type in CPRESTYP.

The example uses a complex dendritic cell (DC) assay panel to illustrate information appropriate for this variable. With the advent of increasingly complex phenotypic assays used to measure proportions, counts, and expression levels on cell subpo pulations, it is sometimes advantageous for a lab/sponsor to provide a more thorough test description in a format used internally t o represent a test and/or that a data recipient can more readily understand. For example, when quantitative marker expression is reported, CPTEST does not indicate the cell population on which expression was measured. Although the marker string of the targ et cell population is included in CPMRKSTR, the actual name of the cell is lost unless it is included as part of the gate name in CPGATE or in CPSPTSTD. CPSPTSTD (Sponsor Test Description) provides the flexibility for combining pieces of info rmation that m ake the test easier to understand and to track internally to lab /sponsor dictionaries using a single variable which is not managed by CDISC Controlled Terminology. Rows 1 - 6: Illustrate how the sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to combine details of a test into a singl e variable to align with the lab/sponsor data repository or dictionary and to aid understanding of the test.",

      "content": "Rows 1 - 4 introduce CPSPTSTD using simple tests for dendritic cells to set the stage for the more complex tests shown in rows 5 - 6. Those rows incorp orate an additional marker (CD1c - ) to define the plasmacytoid sublineage, and a non - lineage, non - cell state marker (CD303+) that is of interest. Although the entire marker string is in CPMRKSTR, it is easy to miss that CD3 03+ was also used to subdivide the population, even though it is not considered to define a sublineage. The lab/sponsor test nomenclature reinforces the use of CD303 by calling them a \"CD303+ Dendritic Cell Plasmacytoid Sub\" (subset) in the CPSPTSTD for rows 5 - 6. The information presented by the lab/sponsor helps the data recipient to quickly understand such nuances of a test at a glance, which is especially useful as the complexity of a test increases. Rows 7 - 10: Illustrate how CPSPTSTD might preface the name of a cell population with cell state marker(s) (e.g., CD83+ in rows 7 - 8) in addition to non - cell state, non - sublineage marker(s). Rows 9 - 10 additionally show that the lab/sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to identify the target cell population by name when it is not in CPTEST, such as when the test is for quantitative single marker expression (CD83 Expression in rows 9 - 10). Rows 11 - 14: Same as rows 7 - 10, except here the cell state activation marker for the CD303+ pDC cell subset and the single marker expression measurement is CD80. Rows 15 - 18: Illustrate how CPSPTSTD might preface the name of a cell population with cell sublineage marker(s) (e.g., CD40+ in rows 15 - 16 in addition to non - cell state, non - sublineage marker(s). Rows 17 - 18 additionally show that the lab/sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to identi fy the target cell population by name when it is not in CPTEST, such as when the test is for quantitative single marker expre ssion (CD40 Expression in rows 17 - 18). Rows 19 - 32: No new concepts are introduced in these rows, but they are additional illustrati ons of using CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, CPCSMRKR and CPSPTSTD for a subset of pDC in which CD123+ is a marker of interest which is neither a cell sublineage nor cell state marker. These rows are included to reinforce the principles ill ustrated in rows 1 - 18.

In addition, three different ways for populating CPGATE and CPGATDEF are shown in the example. Principles related to cell phenotyping are often used to measure the extent of binding between two molecules of interest (e.g ., l igand - receptor or protein - protein interactions). Substances involved in the binding interaction can represent naturally occurring, pathological (i.e., disease - related), or therapeutic intervention processes. Quantification of these types of interactions is often used: (1) to aid in diagnosis and/or tracking disease progression; (2) to determine whether a therapy operating through a binding mechanism works as intended at selected d oses; and (3) to assess whether potential off - target interactions, particularl y those associated with undesirable side effects or safety risks, are likely to be a concern.

Note in this example that the CDxx marker, although it is the target of interest for the test, is not part of the string used to formally identify the named portion of the cell population. As a result, the sponsor chose to report the penultimate gate, which does not include the target marker of interest (CDxx). Beca use the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name, it is identified in CPBDAGNT and/or anoth er variable (e.g. CPTSTPNL). Row 2: Same as row 1 except that the sponsor chose to use CPGATE and CPGATDEF to report information for the final gate rather than t he penultimate gate. In this example, the CDxx marker (the target of interest for measuring occ upancy) is not part of the marker string used to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the test was perf ormed, so it was placed in front of the named portion of the gate to make it easily understood that the final gate was on CDxx - posi tive monocytes (i.e., CDxx+ MONOCYTES). Because the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name, it is identified in CPBDAGNT and/or another variable (e.g. CPTSTPNL). Row 3: The target of interest is also a marker neede d to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the occupancy was measured. For example, proinflammatory mono cytes are distinguished from monocytes based on additional marker expression criteria as CD16+HLADRhi. In the example, the CD16 mar ker was also the target of interest for measuring occupancy. Because CD16 is included in the set of markers used to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the test was performed, it does not need to be explicitly called out in CPGATE.

In the example, target engagement is assessed by measuring the extent to which a cell - associated target protein (the hypothetical cell marker CDxx) is occupied by a therapeutic antibody (CDxx antibody) intended to interact with it. The assay uses a labeled detection antibody to the therapeutic antibody t o measure the proportion of the target bound by the therapeutic antibody in an unaltered specimen (numerator), as compared to the total amount of target available for binding (denominator). The total target available for binding is assessed by saturat ing t he specimen with the therapeutic antibody before measuring the labeled detection antibody. To correct the numerator and denominator for non - specific (background) binding, labeled isotype controls are included which are subtracted to yield specific binding values. Although sponsors may elect to only report the final calculated receptor occupancy (proportion of bound/total target occupied) as in Example 7, this example includes the various measured parameters generated in the assay which are then used to make calculations for the final Receptor Occupancy value.",

Under certain circumstances, assessment of changes to free or unoccupied receptor (target) binding over the time - course of drug therapy or use of an indirect assay format may be more appropriate than direct detection of a binding agent (e.g., drug, small molecule ligand, protein) to obtain information on the extent of target engagement. Indirect assays of thi s sort rely on measuring remaining free (unbound) binding site using a labeled competitive detection probe (e.g., antibody or othe r ligand) that binds to the remaining available sites on the target; that is, those sites not already occupied by treating wi th the therapeutic. (Occupancy of the target by the therapeutic agent is then calculated as the difference between the total number of binding sites and the number of free binding sites detected by the probe.) In addition to measuring the free binding sites, a second labeled probe which binds to a non - interfering alternate site on the target (i.e., is non - competitive with the therapeu tic molecule) may be used to assess the total amount of the target molecule expressed on cells (not binding sites) in order to monitor whether therapy changed the number of targets available relative to baseline expression. This allows results to be interp reted as a change in occupancy as opposed to a change in the number of targets available. Sponsors may choose to report a single test for the final calculated occupancy, such as shown in row 1, or may elect to inclu de results for the entire set of tests co nducted which were then used to calculate the final occupancy result, such as shown in rows 2 through 14. In the example showing the full set of tests, data are reported for free and total binding, background (non - specific) binding, and specific binding.

However, direct assessments of proteins (e.g., assessments of amino a cids) are out of scope for this domain. 2. Regarding genetic testing on non - host organisms (including but not limited to bacteria, viruses, and parasites), the following additional assumptions apply: a. Tests that give genetic results (e.g., expressed in terms of genetic variation, specific sequence information) on non - host organisms that have been identified in subject samples should be represented in GF. To distinguish these findings from subject genetic data, the varia ble NHOID must be populated to identify t he non - host organism as the focus of the record (see Section 9.2, Non - host Organism Identifiers , assumption 2 for more information). b. If the purpose of the test is to detect or determine the identity of a viable, non - ho st organism or infectious agent in a subject sample, data should be represented in the Microbiology Specimen (MB) domain. c. Tests that are used to determine the resistance/susceptibility of a non - host organism to a drug on a genetic basis should be represent ed in the Microbiology Susceptibility (MS) domain.

If the test provides both genetic data and susceptibility/resistance data, genetic data should be represented in GF and the s usceptibility/resistance data should be represented in the MS domain (See Secti on 6.3.5.7.2, Microbiology Susceptibility , assumption 1b for more information). 3. The platform used to detect the finding may be represented in SPDEVID. Attributes used in conjunction with a platform (e.g., assay pan el, reagents) may be represented in the Device Identifiers (DI) domain and other associated device domains. See the SDTM Implementation Guide for Medical Devices (SDTMIG - MD) for further information about SPDEVID and the device domains. 4.

For human genetic data, standard nomenclature populated in variable GFSYM must be obtained from the genomic symbol list maintained in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database ( www.genenames.org ) . 6. When populating GFGENSR, caution should be exercised for annotations of loci where more than 1 annotation applies. In such ca ses, the source of the annotation should be captured and documented in Define - XML. In addition, the value populated in GFGENSR ma y be dependent on the precision of the value populated in GFSEQID. 7. Values populated in GFGENREF, GFSEQID, and GFPVRID should reflect the level of granularity collected (e.g., version, build, patch, release) to support interpretation of the reported result. 8.

Tests that diagnose or identify the presence of an infectious agent in a subject sample are represented in the MB domain, regardless of the methodology used. In this example, the subject was diagnosed with influenza A H3N2 via a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the baseline visit.

Findings from this testing provide both genetic data in the form of the genotype identified and the susceptibility/resistance data as inferred phenotype. Genotypic findings are represented i n the GF domain, and inferred susceptibility/resistance in MS. The GFTEST \"Single Nucleotide Variation\" is used for SNP tests. GFT STDTL indicates that the results are expressed as predicted amino acid change instead of nucleotide change. GFSYM = \"NA\", the published gene symbol for the influenza neuraminidase gene. GFGENLOC represents the position in the protein sequence where the tar geted variation which confers resistance to oseltamivir occurs.

The Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments (IS) domain holds assessments that describe whether a therapy (e.g., biologic, drug, vaccine) provoked/caused/induced an immune response in a subject. The response can be either positive or negative. For example, a vacc ine is expected to induce a beneficial immune response, whereas a cellular therapy (e.g., erythropoiesis - stimulating agents) may cause an adverse immune response. 2. The IS domain also holds assessments that describe whether an allergen, microorganism, or endogenous molecule provoked /caused/induced an immune response in a subject, such as a subject's antibody reaction (autoantibodies) against auto/self - antigens for autoimmune studies or antibody production in response to allergens in allergy trials. Expected outputs can be positive or negative, present or absent for the antibody of interest, as well as quantification of the antibody. Assessments pertaining to antibodies produced in response to microbial infection will also be represented in the IS domain.

Assessments about all other ty pes of \"induced\" humoral (antibody) immune response in a subject (e.g., antibodies against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins) will also be represented in the IS domain. 4. Certain types of cellular immune responses will also be modeled in IS using non - fl ow cytometry techniques (see example 6). Flow cytometry data should be modeled in the Cell Phenotype Findings (CP) domain, section 6.3.5.3. 5. An exception is made to the class of antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assa ys.",

An example is fourth - generation HIV Ag/Ab combination tests, which are commonly seen as HIV identification or detection assays rather t han tests that provide additional details on and characterization of a subject’s immunological responses. The outputs of these assays can be expected as reactive, non - reactive, or indeterminate. Whereas some tests generate separate outputs for antigen and antibody, others just indicate “reactive” when either or both are detected. Output is generally based on relative light units, where a result of \"reactive\" typically requires the signal to cutoff ratio to be greater than 1. 6. Measurements of cytokines, chemo kines, and complement proteins should be represented in the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain. 7. The IS domain variable ISBDAGNT (Binding Agent) is currently supported by 2 Controlled Terminology codelists: Microorganism ( MICROORG) and Binding Agent for Im munogenicity Tests (ISBDAGT). Controlled Terminology Rules for Immunogenicity Tests describes how and when to use each codelist (see https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminol ogy/controlled - terminology ). a. For antidrug antibody (ADA) tests, the ISBDAGNT variable is used to represent the free - text description of the name/identity of the therapy the antidrug antibody targets. CDISC does not control study therapy names (e.g., drugs , biologics). For ADA tests as a part of regulatory agency submissions, the proprietary binding study therapy name(s) should be considered as extended values of the ISBDAGT codelist wh en represented in Define - XML. b. For mixed - allergens panel tests, submissio n values represented in the ISBDAGNT variable should follow this format: “XXX, Multiple” (e.g., Dairy Mix Antigens, Multiple; Animal Mix Antigens, Multiple; use the plural form for the word “antigen” if needed).

Tiered testing scheme for ADA evaluation generally includes the following steps: screening, confirmatory, and \"characterizati on\" of the antidrug antibody. In tier 1, all evaluable samples are run in a screening assay. Samples that are positive for ADA in the screen assay are then analyzed in a confirmatory assay (tier 2). The samples that ar e positive for ADA in both the screen and confirmatory tiers of testing are further tested in tier 3; this freq uently includes analysis of antibody titer and neutralizing activity. In order to illustrate the distinctive differences betw een the 3 tiers of ADA testing, the standard variable ISTSTOPO is used to represent the controlled values SCREEN, CONFIRM, and QUAN TIFY. These values help to describe the operational objective or the reason behind each testing step/tier, and also to provid e uniqueness to each row of record.

The following 2 examples introduce the IS domain - specific variable, ISMSCBCE, and illustrate its use with ISTEST to represent a complete immunological analyte of interest. Example 6 This example shows data about the assessment of antibody - secreting cells (ASCs). Traditional methods such as enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that monitor humoral immune responses after immunization or infection typically only quant ify specific antibody titers in serum. These methods do not provide any information about the actual number and location of the immune cells that secrete antibodies or cy tokines. The enzyme - linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay is a method to detect and quantify analyte - secreting T or B cells. During ELISpot testing, a colored precipitate forms and appears as spots at the sites of analyte localization (analytes typically are cytokines or antibodies), with each individual spot representing an individual analyte - sec reting cell. The spots can be counted with an automated ELISpot reader system or manually, using a stereomicroscope. This example shows how to represent the quantification of ASCs as the number of spots per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as determined by B - cell ELISpot from a vaccine trial. The IS domain - specific variable ISMSCBCE introduced in this example allows flexibility in data representation and post - coordination of the various secreted antibody types and their respective ASCs.

Through vaccination, it is expected that cytokine secretion in immune cells is boosted whenever immune cells encounter the same virus and/or the previously exposed viral antigens. By increasing this cytokine secretion, immune cells aid in the host defen se and protection against (re - )infections. In vaccine trials, this can be measured by isolating immune cells (e.g., PBMCs) from subjects at multiple time p oints during the course of the trial and restimulating them with the virus or its viral antigens in v itro. In this example, PBMCs were isolated from a subject participating a vaccine study for RSV and restimulated in vitro with eith er a RSV - antigen or without a stimulating agent.

Example 8 In vaccine studies, microneutralization assays are commonly used in assays to quantify viral - specific neutralizing antibodies in a subject’s specimen that can block viral infection in vitro, and therefore provide a measure of vaccine efficacy. A neutralizi ng antibody is an antibody that binds to, blocks, and prevents non - self agents from infecting cells . When immunizing a subject with a vaccine, the hope is that the vaccine will induce antiviral and humoral - protective antibody responses in the subject; with an effective vaccine, the quantity of virus - specific antibodies that are able to block viral infection are increased. To test the efficacy of a vaccine, a microneutralization test is perfor med by adding a vaccinated subject's serum and the virus of study interest to cell cultures in vitro. If neutralizing antibodies are present in the subject's serum post - vaccination, those antibodies will bind to, block, and prevent the virus from infecting cells in the culture plates. The neutralization titer is the spec ific dilution of the antibody that blocks viral infection of the cells. The 50% neutralization titer (also known as NT50), in the context of microneutralization assays, is d efined as the antiviral antibody titer that blocks 50% of viral infection of the ce lls. Note: Some users may represent the 50% neutralization titer as \"IC50 titer\" or other test descriptors. CDISC recommends mapping all such values in the ISTSTDTL variable. NHOID is populated with respiratory syncytial virus because this microorganism is the subject of the vaccine efficacy test. NHOID, defined by the Non - host Organism Identifiers (OI) domain, should be used to map microorganisms that have been either experimentally determined i n the course of a study or are previously known (e.g., lab str ains used as reference in the study). In other words, NHOID is used when the study subject is the microorganism, and when the microorganism is present in the testing sample.",

E xamples of such tests include microneutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, and opsonophagocytic - killing assays. These are tests that measure the direct effect of the antimicrobial antibodies on the microorganism; therefore, said microorganism is the s tudy subject and should be mapped to NHOID. This example uses data from the same RSV vaccine study, where the subject is being vaccinated with a viral vector containing RSV.

      "content": "Typically, this test is performed by incubating a subject's post - immunization sera with the bacterial strain of interest, pha gocytes, and complement proteins. If antibacterial, functional antibodies are present in the subject's serum, those antibodies will bind to the bacteria together with complement proteins. This subsequently targets the bacteria for opsonization, the ingesti on and destruction of invading non - self agents by phagocytes. With vaccination, the quantity of bacterial - specific, functional antibodies are increased, leading to a decreased number of viable bacterial cells in the presence of pha gocytes, functional antib odies, and complement. The assay read - out is expressed in by the opsonization index, which is calculated using linear interpolation of the serum dilution containin g functional antibody killing the desired percentage (usually 50%) of the bacteria, using a s pecified algorithm. NHOID is populated with Staphylococcus aureus 04 - 02981 because this strain of S. aureus is the subject of the vaccine efficacy test. NHOID, defined by the Non - host Organism Identifiers (OI) domain, should be used to map microorganisms t hat have been either experimentally determined in the course of a study or are previously known (e.g., lab strains used as reference in the study). In other words, NHOID is used when the study subject is the microorganism, and w hen the microorganism is pre sent in the testing sample. In vaccine efficacy studies, a subject’s post - immunization sera is often incubated with a microbial strain of interest, where the functional capacities of the vaccine - induced antibodies are measured through whether the antibodie s can effectively stop (from infection), neutralize, and kill the study microorganism of interest, in vitro. Examples of such tests include mic roneutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, and opsonophagocytic - killing assays. These are tests that measure the direct effect of the antimicrobial antibodies on the microorganism; therefore, said microorganism is the study subject an d should be mapped to NHOID. In this vaccine - study example, the subject is vaccinated with a vector containing S. aureus - epitope X (note: epitope X is an example, refer to controlled terminology for standard terms associated with ISBDAGNT).",

This domain captures laboratory data collected on the CRF or received from a central provider or ve ndor. 2. For lab tests that do not have continuous numeric results (e.g., urine protein as measured by dipstick, descriptive tests suc h as urine color), LBSTNRC could be populated either with normal range values that are a range of character values for an ord inal scale (e.g., “NEGATIVE to TRACE\") or a delimited set of values that are considered to be normal (e.g., “YELLOW”, “AMBER”). LBORNRLO, LBORNRHI, LBSTNRLO, and LBSTNRH I should be null for these types of tests. 3. LBNRIND can be added to indicate where a re sult falls with respect to reference range defined by LBORNRLO and LBORNRHI. Examples: \"HIGH\", \"LOW\". If toxicity grading is available, values would be represented in the variables LBTOX and LBTOXGR. Clinical significanc e would be represented as described in Section 4.5.5, Clinical Significance for Findings Observation Class Data , in LBCLSIG (see also LB Example 1). 4.

Rows 4 - 5: Show 2 derived records (mean of records 2 and 3 and maximum value of records 2 and 3) grouped by a common LBGRPID value. The derived result in row 4 is described as a mean (LBCOLSRT=\"MEAN, ARITHMETIC\"), but LBDRVFL is missing because t he mean result was provided by the vendor. The derived result in row 5 was derived by the sponsor, and so is flagged as derived (LBDRVFL=\"Y\"); LBCOLSRT i s not populated because the result is not a collected summary result. For both derived results, the spo nsor chose to populate LBRESSCL, LBRESTYP, LBSPEC, and LBFAST consistent with the 2 individual alkaline phosphatase records but did not populate LBLOINC or LBPTFL becau se neither derived record represented a single point in time. The sponsor chose to popul ate LBDTC with the first of the 2 specimen collection dates. Row 6: Shows use of LBTMTHSN to represent \"HIGH SENSITIVITY\" for the high - sensitivity C - reactive protein (hs - CRP) test. Rows 7, 10: Show use of LBTSTCND. For the cryoglobulin test, 1 - day cold inc ubation is noted; for the platelet aggregation test, collagen induced is noted. Row 8: Shows use of LBLLOD for a prostate - specific antigen test. Row 9: Shows use of LBPDUR to represent the planned duration of \"PT24H\" for collection of urine samples for the protein test. LBPTFL is set to missing because this test was not conducted at a single point in time. Rows 12 - 13: Show a suggested use of the LBSCAT variable.

In cases of tests that target an organism, group of organisms, or antigen for identification, MBTEST equals the name of the o rganism/antigen targeted by the identification assay, and i. MBTSTDTL should be “DETECTION”. ii. The result should generally be \"PRESENT\"/\"ABSENT\", \"POSITIVE\"/\"NEGATIVE\", or \"INDETERMINATE\". However, there may be cases where a test differentiates between 2 or more similar organisms, in which case it would be appropriate for the result to be the name of the organism det ected. For example, a test may look for influenza A or influenza B antigen. In this case, MBTEST would be \"Influenza A/B Antigen\"; the result could be \"INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN\", \"INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN\", or \"INFLUENZA A/B ANTIGEN\". b. For non - targeted identification of organisms (i.e., tests that have the ability to identify a range of organisms without specifically targeting any), the value for MBTESTCD/MBTEST should be \"MCORGIDN\"/\"Microbial Organism Identification\", and the result should be the name of the organism or group of organisms found to be present (e.g., \"INFLUENZA A VIRUS SUBTYPE H1N1\"; \"CLONORCHIS SINENSIS \" ).

The method used by both labs was a s olid microbial culture (MBMETHOD).

Because an identified organism is the subject of the test, the NHOID variable is populated with \"ENTEROCOCC US FAECALIS\". Between the 2 labs (MSNAM), a total of 3 susceptibility testing methods were used: epsilometer, disk diffusion, and macro broth dilution (MSMETHOD). Epsilometer and disk diffusion both use agar diffusion methods, in which an agar plate is ino culated with the microorganism of interest and either a strip (epsilometer) or discs (disk diffusion) containing various concentrations of the drug are placed on the agar plate. The epsilometer test method provides both a minimum inhibitory concentration (MSTESTCD = \"MIC\"), the lowest concentration of a drug that inhibits the growth of a microorganism, and a qualitative interpretation (MSTESTCD = \"MICROSUS\") such as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. The disk diffusion test method provides the diam eter of the zone of inhibition CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc.",

This domain holds findings resulting from the microscopic examination of tissue samples. These examinations are performed on a specimen, usually one that has been prepared with some type of stain. Some examinations of cells in fluid specimens (e.g., blood, urine) are cl assified as lab tests and should be stored in the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain. Biomarkers assessed by histologic or histopathological examination (by employing cytochemical/immunocytochemical stains) are stored in the MI domain. 2. When biomarker results are represented in MI, MITES TCD reflects the biomarker of interest (e.g., \"BRCA1\", \"HER2\", \"TTF1\"), and MITSTDTL further qualifies the record. MITSTDTL is used to represent details descriptive of staining results (e.g., \"H SCORE TOTAL SCO RE\", \"STAINING INTENSITY\", \"PERCENT POSITIVE C ELL\"). 3.

PCTPTREF is a text value of the description of a “zero” time (e.g., time of dosing). It should be meaningful. If there are mu ltiple PK profiles being generated, the zero time for e ach will be different (e.g., a different dose such as first dose, second dose) and, as a result, values for PCTPTREF must be different. In this example, such values f or PCTPTREF are required to make values of PCTPTNUM and PCTPT unique (see Section 4.4.10, Representing Time Points ). Rows 1 - 2: Show day 1 pre - dose drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma and urine. Rows 3 - 4: Show day 1 pre - dose drug and metabolite concentrations in urine. Urine specimens may be collec ted over an interval; both PCDTC and PCENDTC have been populated with the same value to indicate that these specimens were collected at a point in time rather than over an interval. Rows 5 - 6: Show specimen properties (VOLUME and PH) for the day 1 pre - dose urine specimens. These have a PCCAT value of \"SPECIMEN PROPERTY\". Rows 7 - 12: Show day 1 post - dose drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Rows 13 - 16: Show day 11 drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Rows 17 - 20: Show day 11 drug and metabolit e concentrations in urine specimens collected over an interval. The elapsed times for urine samples are calculated as the ela psed time (from the reference time point, PCTPTREF) to the end of the specimen collection interval. Elapsed time values that are th e same for urine and plasma samples have been assigned the same value for PCTPT. For the urine samples, the value in PCEVLINT describes the planned evaluation (or collection) interval relative to the time point. The actual evalua tion interval can be determ ined by subtracting PCDTC from PCENDTC.

Pharmacokinetics Parameters is a derived dataset, and may be produced from an analysis dataset with a different structure. As a result, some sponsors may need to normalize their analysis dataset in order for it to fit into the SDTM - based PP domain. 2. Information pertaining to all parameters (e.g., number of exponents, model weighting) should be submitted in the SUPPPP datas et. 3. There are separate codelists used for PPORRESU/PPSTRESU where the choice depends on whether the value of the pharmacokinetic parameter is normalized. a. Codelist “PKUNIT” is used for non - normalized parameters. b. Codelists “PKUDMG” and “PKUDUG” are used when parameters are normalized by dose amount in milligrams or micrograms, respectiv ely. c. Codelists “PKUWG” and “PKUWKG” are used when parameters are normalized by weight in grams or kilograms, respectively.

This may be done in analysis dataset metadata or by documenting relationships between records in the Pharmacokinetics Parameters (PP) and Pharmacokinetics Concentrations (PC) datasets in a RELREC dataset (see Section 8.2, Relating Peer Records , and Section 8.3, Re lating Datasets ). PC - PP – Relating Datasets If all time - point concentrations in PC are used to calculate all parameters for all subjects, then the relationship between the 2 dataset s can be documented as shown in this table: relrec.xpt Row STUDYID RDOMAIN USUBJID IDVAR IDVARVAL RELTYPE RELID 1 ABC - 123 PC PCGRPID MANY A 2 ABC - 123 PP PPGRPID MANY A Note that the reference time point and the analyte are part of the natural key (see Section 3.2.1.1, Primary Keys ) for both datasets. In this relationship, -- GRPID is a surrogate key, and must be populated so that each combination of analyte and reference time point has a separate value of -- GRPID. PC - PP – Relating Records This section illustrates 4 methods for representing relationships between PC and PP records under 4 different circumstances. All these examples are based on the same PC and PP data for 1 drug (i.e., drug X). The different methods for representing relationships are based on which linking variables are used in RELREC. • Method A (many to many, using PCGRPID and PPGRPID) • Method B (one to many, using PCSEQ and PPGRPID) • Method C (many to one, using PCGRPID and PPSEQ) CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc.

As in the example above, -- GRPID values must take into account all the combinations of analytes and reference time points; both are part of the natural key for both datasets. For each example, PCGRPID and PPGRPID were used to group related records within each respective dataset. The exclusion of some concentration values from the calculation of some parameters affects th e values of PCGRPID and PPGRPID for the different situations.",

      "content": "Method A is clearly the most efficient in terms of having the least number of RELREC records, but it does require the assignment of -- GRPID values (which are optional) in both the PC and PP datasets. Method D, in contrast, does not require the assignment of -- GRPID values, relying instead on the required -- SEQ values in both datasets to relate the records. Although Method D results in the largest number of RELREC records compared to the o ther methods, it may be the easiest to implement consistently across the range of complexities shown in the examples. Two additional methods, methods B and C, are also shown for Examples 1 - 3. They represent hybrid approaches, using -- GRPID values in only 1 dataset (PP and PC, respectively) and -- SEQ values for the other. These methods are best suited for sponsors who want to minimize the number of RELREC records while not having to assign -- GRPID values in both domains. Methods B and C would not be ideal, h owever, if one expected complex scenarios as shown in Example 4. Note that an attempt has been made to approximate real pharmacokinetic data; however, the example values are not intended to reflect data used for actual analysis. When certain time - point con centrations have been omitted from PP calculations in Examples 2 - 4, the actual parameter values in the PP dataset have not been recalculated from those in Example 1 to reflect those omissions. PC - PP – Suggestions for Implementing RELREC in the Submission o f PK Data Determine which of the scenarios best reflects how PP data are related to PC data. Questions that should be considered include: 1. Do all parameters for each PK profile use all concentrations for all subjects? If so, create a PPGRPID value for all PP records and a PCGRPID value for all PC records for each profile for each subject, analyte, and reference time point. Decide whether to relate datasets or records. If choosing the latter, create records in RELREC for each PCGRPID value and each PPGRP ID value (method A). Use RELID to show which PCGRPID and PPGRPID records are related. Consider RELREC methods B, C, and D as applicable. 2. Do all parameters use the same concentrations, although maybe not all of them (Example 2)? If so, create a single PPGRP ID value for all PP records, and 2 PCGRPID values for the PC records: a PCGRPID value for ones that were used and a PCGRPID value for those that were not used. Create records in RELREC for each PCGRPID value and each PPGRPID value (method A).",

When the Morphology domain was introduced in SDTMIG v3.2, the SDS Team planned to represent morphology and physiology f indings in separate domains: morphology findings in the MO domain and physiology findings in separate domains by body systems. Since then, the team found that separating morphology and physiology findings was more difficult than anticipated and provided li ttle added value. This led to the decision to expand the body system - based domains to cover both morphology and physiology findings and to deprecate MO in a future version of the SDTMIG. Submissions using that later SDTMIG version would represent morpholog y results in the appropriate body system - based physiology/morphology domain. For data prepared using a version of the SDTMIG that includes both the MO domain and body system - based physiology/morphology domains, morphology findings may be represented in eit her the MO domain or in a body - system based physiology/morphology domain.

The RELREC table uses -- LNKID to relate the PR and AG domains to each other and to NV, and -- REFID to relate NV and Device in Use (DU). In this example, the sponsor has maintained 2 sets of reference identifiers (REFID values) for the specific purp ose of being able to relate records across multiple domains. Because the SDTMIG - MD advocates the use of -- REFID to link a group of settings to the results obtained from the reading or interpretation of the test (see SDTMIG - MD, Device - in - Use (DU) domain ass umptions), -- LNKID has been used to establish the relationships between the procedure, the substance administered during the procedure, and the results obtained from the proce dure. -- LNKID is unique for each procedure for each subject, so datasets may be r elated to each other as a whole.

VEPs are detected via an EEG using leads that are placed on the back of the subject’s head. It is important to note that the nature of VEP testing is such that NVMETH OD should be equal to \"EEG\", and that NVCAT should be equal to \"VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIAL\". Several latencies from ea ch eye — including N75, P100, and N145, as well as the P100 peak - to - peak amplitude (75 - 100) — are collected and should be represented in NVTESTCD/NVTEST. Details about the VEP equipment including the checkerboard size should be represented in the appropriate d evice domains. To interpret, each VEP component is compared against normative values established by the laboratory using healthy controls. In this example, a VEP component is considered abnormal if it falls outside of 3 standard deviations from the normati ve lab mean. These low and high values are stored in NVORNRLO and NVORNRHI, respectively, and the interpretation of each VEP component is represented in NVNRIND.

RE – Examples Example 1 This example shows results from several spirometry tests using either a spirometer or a peak flow meter. When spirometry test s are performed, the subject usually makes several efforts, each of which produces results, but only the best result for each test is used in analyses. In this study, t he sponsor collected only the best results. The Device Identifiers (DI) domain was submitted for device identification, and the Dev ice in Use (DU) domain was submitted to provide information about the use of the device. Because the original and standardized units of measure are identical in this example, RESTRESC, RESTRESN, RESTRESU, and RESTR EFN are not shown.

PE findings reflect the presence or absence of physical signs of disease or abnormality observed during a general physical exami nation. Multiple body systems are assessed during a physical examination, often starting at the head and ending at the toes, where the body is evaluated by inspection, palpation (feeling with the hands), percussion (tapping with fingers), and auscultation (listening). The examination often includes macro assessments (e.g., normal/abnormal) of appearance, general health, behavior, and body system review from head to toe. a. Evaluation of targeted body systems (e.g., cardiovascular, ophthalmic, reproductive) as part of therapeutic specific assessments should be represented in the appropriate body system domain (e.g., CV, OE, RP, respective ly). b. See CDASHIG Section 8.3.11, PE - Physical Examination (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/cdash/ ), for additional collection guidance. 2. Abnormalities observed during a physical examination may be encoded. When collected/reported as a PE finding, the verbatim va lue is represented in PEORRES and the encoded value in PESTRESC. When collected/reported as medical history or an adverse event, th e verbatim value is represented in MHTERM or AETERM and the encoded value is represented in MHDECOD or AEDECOD, respectively. 3.

All rights res erved Page 321 2021 - 11 - 29 FT – Assumptions The following assumptions are unique to the FT domain: 1. A functional test is not a subjective assessment of how the subject generally performs a task, but rather an objective measurement of the performance of the task by the subject in a specific instance. 2. Functional tests have documented methods for administration and analysis and requ ire a subject to perform specific activities that are evaluated and recorded. Most often, functional tests are direct quantitative measurements. Examples of functional tests include the Timed 25 - Foot Walk, 9 - Hole Peg Test, and the Hauser Ambulation Index. QRS Shared Assumptions The following assumptions are common to the FT and QS domains as well as the Clinical Classifications use case of the RS doma in (not the Disease Response use case of RS): 1. The name of a QRS instrument is described under the variable - - CAT in the relevant QRS domain (i.e., FT, QS, RS), and may be either abbreviations or longer names. For example, \"ADAS - COG\", \"BPI SHORT FORM\", and \"APACHE II\" are all -- CATs which are shortened names for the instruments they represent, whereas \"4 STAIR AS CEND\" is the FTCAT for the instrument of the same name. Sponsors should always reference CDISC Controlled Terminology. a.

Names of subcategories for groups of items/questions are described under the -- SCAT variable. a. -- SCAT values are not included in the CDISC Controlled Terminology system but rather controlled as described in the QRS supplem ents in which they are used. 3. There are cases where QRS CRFs do not inclu de numeric “standardized responses” assigned to text responses (e.g., mild, moderate, severe being 1, 2, 3). It is clearly in everyone's best interest to include the numeric “standardized responses” in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. This is only done when the num eric “standardized responses” are documented in the QRS CRF instructions, a user manual, a website specific to the QRS instru ment, or another reference document that provides a clear explanation and rationale for providing them in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. 4. S ponsors should always consult published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in a SDTMIG QRS domain . Derived variable results in QRS are usually considered captured data. If sponsors operationally derive variable results, then the derived records that are submitted in a QRS domain should be flagged by -- DRVFL. a.

It is considered a captured subtotal or total score without any knowledge of the sponsor - data management p rocesses related to the score. i. If operationally derived by the sponsor, it is the sponsor's responsibility to set the -- DRVFL flag based on their eCRF process to derive subtotal and total scores. An investigator - derived score written on a CRF will be consi dered a captured score and not flagged. When subtotal and total scores are derived by the sponsor, the derived flag ( -- DRVFL) is set to \"Y\". However, when the subtotal and total scores are received from a central provider or vendor, the value would go into -- ORRES and -- DRVFL would be null (see Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for Variables ). 5. The variable -- REPNUM variable is populated when there are multiple repeats of the same question. When records are related to the first trial of the question, the variable -- REPNUM should be set to \"1\". When records are related to the second trial of the same question, -- REPNUM should be set to \"2\", and so forth. 6. The actual version number of an instrument is represented in the -- CAT value as designated by the QRS Terminology Team. If it is determined that this is not the case for an instrument: a. Notify the QRS Terminology Team that the instrument has a specific or multiple version numbers. This team will assist in providing an resolut ion on how the situation will be handled. b.

RSCAT is used to group a set of assessments based on a disease response criterion (published or protocol - defined). One of the codelists for RSCAT is ONCRSCAT. The ONCRSCAT codelist contains controlled terminology for oncology disease response assessments. 2. Oncology response criteria assess the change in tumor burden, an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: Both tumor shrinkage (objective response) and disease progression are useful endpoints in cancer clinical trials. The RS domain is applicable for representing responses to assessment criteria such as RECIST[1] or Lugano classification.[2] The SDTM domain examples provided reference RECIST. Disease Response supplements will be developed as 1 supplement per response criterion and will c ontained criterion - specific guidance and examples. a. CDISC submission values and definitions in the ONCRSR codelist have been developed to facilitate reuse by keeping the definit ions focused on the meaning of the result rather than on relating them to a spe cific published criterion or a particular tumor type. CDISC submission values and definitions are intended to apply across multiple tumor types, imaging modalities, therapeutic agents, and published criterio n. This means that there may be cases where the a ppropriate ONCRSR CDISC submission value may not exactly match the term used in the published criterion. It is expected that clinicians should use the precise criterion definitions outlined in the individual papers to assign the appropr iate response accord ing to the CDISC submission values. b. The terms \"response\" and \"remission\" are commonly used to describe functionally synonymous terms. \"Response\" is used in CDISC submission values based on the following agreement: FDA, CDISC, NCI - EVS, and select academic e xperts came to consensus that because the words \"response\" (used in solid tumors as an indicator of a favorable change in tumor burden) and \"remission\" (used in non - solid tumors) were functionally synonymous, 2 distinct terms were not required to be added to the ONCRSR codelist. Instead, \"remission\" has been added as a synonym in all instances where \"response\" is used in a CDISC submission value, for response values used in both solid and non - solid tumors.",

The RS domain disease response criteria use case may include rec ords derived by the investigator or with a data collection tool, but not sponsor - derived records. Sponsor - derived records and results should be provided in an analysis dataset (ADaM). a. For disease response criteria, the BEST Response assessment records are included in the RS domain only when provided by the investigator or an independent assessor (i.e., Best responses that are derived by the sponsor for the analysis are not included in the RS domain ). 4. The RSLNKGRP variable is used to provide a link between the records in a findings domain (e.g., Tumor/Lesion Results, TR; Laboratory Test Results, LB) that contribute to a record in the RS domain. Records should exist in the RELREC dataset to support this relationship. A RELREC relationship could also be define d using RSLNKID when a response evaluation or clinical classification measure relates back to another source dataset (e.g., tumor assessment in TR). The domain in which data that contribute to an assessment of response reside should not affect whether a l i nk to the RS record through a RELREC relationship is created. For example, a set of oncology response criteria might require lab results in the L B domain, not only tumor results in the TR domain. 5.

In the oncology setting, the response to therapy would often be determined, at least in part, from data in the TR domain. Data from other sources (in other SDTM domains) might also be used in an assessment of response (e.g., lab test results, assessments of symptoms). c. Oncology response assessments sometimes include symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deteriora tion may be considered as non - radiologic evidence of progressive disease. Symptomatic deterioration is recorded in RS with RSTEST = \"Symptomatic Deterioration\" and the standardized response (e.g., \"PD\") in RSSTRESC.

Likewise, the link to Procedures (PR; e.g., radiotherapy, surgery) would be made using PRLNKGRP. b. If the criteria used to determine the response is unknown or not collected, this is represented as RSCAT = \"UNSPECIFIED\". 7. The evaluator identifier variable (RSEVALID) can be used in conjunction with RSEV AL to provide additional detail of who is providing the assessment. For example, RSEVAL = \"INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR\" and RSEVALID = \"RADIOLOGIST 1\" may further qualify the RSEVALID variable. RSEVALID may be subject to controlled terminology but may also repres ent free text values depending on the use case. When used with disease response data, RSEVALID is subject to MEDEVAL controlled terminology. 8.

      "content": "6.3.9.3.2 Clinical Classifications Use Case RS – Clinical Classifications Use Case Assumptions The following assumptions are unique to the RS domain clinical classifications use case: 1. Clinical classifications are named instrument s whose output is an ordinal or categorical score that serves as a surrogate for or ranking of disease status or other physio logical or biological status. a. Clinical classifications may be based solely on objective data from clinical records, or they may involve a clinical judgment or interpretation of directly observable signs, behaviors, or other physical manifestations related to a condition or subject status. These physical manifestations may be findings (e.g., lab results, vi tal signs, clinic al events) that are typically represented in other SDTM domains . 2. RSCAT is used to group a set of assessments based on a clinical classification. One of the codelists for RSCAT is CCCAT. The CCCAT codelist contains CDISC Controlled Terminology for clinical classifications instruments. 3. When using the RS domain to represent a clinical classification instrument that incorporate s data from other domains: a. Whenever possible, all source data must be represented in the topic - based domain(s) to which they pertain. For example, if a lab test value is collected and then scored for a response evaluation or clinical classification instrument, the lab test value must be recorded in the LB domain using the rules that apply to that d omain and the tests being repre sented. b. If the source value is directly collected on the clinical classification instrument, then the values from the source record m ay be transcribed to the corresponding RS record, with RSORRES and RSORRESU populated to agree with the units shown on the clinical classification instrument, which may be different from the sponsor’s usual practice for original and standard units. c. If a clinical classification uses a a source value by comparing it to a range (e.g., \"2 - 5\", \">3\"), then the source value will exis t only in the source domain; the range is represented in the corresponding RS record in RSORRES and RSORRESU. d. In all cases, RSSTRESC/RSSTRESN should be populated with the assigned ordinal score as indicated on the instrument.

The name of a QRS instrument is described under the variable -- CAT in the relevant QRS domain (i.e., F T, QS, RS), and may be either abbreviations or longer names. For example, \"ADAS - COG\", \"BPI SHORT FORM\", and \"APACHE II\" are all -- CATs which are shortened names for the instruments they represent, whereas \"4 STAIR ASCEND\" is the FTCAT for the instrument of the same name. Sponsors should always reference CDISC Controlled Terminology. a.

There are cases where QRS CRFs do not include numeric “standardized responses” assigned to text re sponses (e.g., mild, moderate, severe being 1, 2, 3). It is clearly in everyone's best interest to include the numeric “standardized responses” in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. This is only done when the numeric “standardized responses” are documented in the QRS CRF instructions, a user manual, a website specific to the QRS instrument, or another reference document that provides a clear explanation and rationale for providing them in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. 4.

The structure of the SC domain formerly was 1 record per characteristic (test) per subject, b ut with this version of the SDTMIG the structure has changed to allow multiple records per test. This example shows multiple estimates of gestational age for the same subject. Not all of the values of MET HOD shown in this example are currently in the METHO D codelist. Gestational age is often expressed (and sometimes collected) in weeks and days. SDTM does not support the recording of an ind ividual finding result with mixed units (e.g., \"20 weeks and 5 days\"), so the gestational age would be converted to day s for representation in SDTM. sc.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID SCSEQ SCTESTCD SCTEST SCCAT SCORRES SCORRESU SCSTRESC SCSTRESN SCSTRESU SCMETHOD VISITNUM SCDTC SCDY 1 ABC - 123 SC 101 1 EGESTAGE Estimated Gestational Age PREGNANCY - RELATED FINDINGS 100 DAYS 100 100 DAYS MENSTRUAL HISTORY 10 2017 - 03 - 02 196 2 ABC - 123 SC 101 2 EGESTAGE Estimated Gestational Age PREGNANCY - RELATED FINDINGS 135 DAYS 135 135 DAYS ULTRASOUND 11 20 - 17 - 04 - 01 226 3 ABC - 123 SC 101 3 EGESTAGE Estimated Gestational Age PREGNANCY - RELATED FINDINGS 265 DAYS 265 265 DAYS BALLARD 13.1 20 - 17 - 06 - 10 297 Example 3 This example shows data from a multi - year study in which marital status and whether the subject was a student were collected annually.",

The identification information, including the location description, must not be repeated for every visit. A record is required in TU to identify and create the TULNKID when there are associated reco rds in TR with matching TRLNKID. The followi ng are examples of when post - baseline records might be included in the TU domain: a. A new tumor/lesion may emerge at any time during a study; therefore, a new post - baseline record would represent the identification of the new tumor/lesion. b. If a tumor/lesion identified at baseline subsequently splits into separate distinct tumors/lesions, then additional post - baseline records can be included to distinctly identify the split tumors/lesions.

The following example shows the preferred approach for representing split lesions in TU. However, the approach depends on how the data f or split and merged tumors/lesions are captured. The preferred approach requires the measurements of each distinct tumor/lesion to be captured individually. Example target tumor T04, identified at the screening visit, splits into 2 at week 16. Two new reco rds are created with TUTEST = \"Tumor Split”; TULNKID reflects the split by adding 0.1 and 0.2 to the original TULNKID value.

The TR domain represents quantitative measurements and/or qualitative assessmen ts of the tumors, lesions, or locations of interest (e.g., tumors, cardiovascular culprit lesions, organs, bone marrow, other sites of disease such as lymph nodes) identified in the Tumor/Lesion Identificati on (TU) domain. These measurements or qualitative assessments may be recorded at baseline and then at each subsequent assessment to support response evaluations. A typical rec ord in the TR domain contains the following information: • a unique tumor/lesion/location of interest ID value • test and result • metho d used • role of the individual making the assessment • timing information Clinically accepted evaluation criteria expect that a tumor/lesion/location of interest identified by the ID is the same tumor/lesion/location of interest a t each subsequent assessment.

It is not intended that the sponsor would create derived records to supply t hose values in the TR domain. Derived records/results (outside the CRF) should be provided in th e analysis dataset (ADaM). 4. In order to support data value standardization it is sometimes appropriate to standardize an original result value in TRORRES to a standardized result value in TRSTRESC and TRSTRESN. For example, in the published RECIST criteria, a standardized value of 5 mm is used in the calculation to determine response when a tumor is “too small to measure.\" The original or collected value \"TOO SMALL TO MEASURE\" should be r epresented in the TRORRES variable and the standardized value should be represented in the TRSTRESC and TRSTRESN variables.

In this example, when TRTEST = \"Tumor State\" and TRORRES = \"ABSENT\", it indicates that the target lymph node lesion was no longer pathological (i.e ., diameter reduced below 10mm). The overall assessment of lymph nodes is represented with TRTEST = \"Lymph Nodes State\". A lymph node state of \"NON - PATHOLOGICAL\" means that all target lymph node lesions have a short axis less than 10mm. A lymph node state of \"PATHOLOGICAL\" means that at least 1 target lymph node lesion has a short axis greater than or equal to 10mm.

Not all findings associated with an e vent or intervention should be represented in the FA structure. The following are criteria for using the FA structure. Criterion 1: Data or observations that have different timing from an associated event or intervention as a whole Per Section 6.2.1, Adverse Events , assumption 7.e, \"I t is the sponsor's responsibility to define an event.\" One common practice is to define an event as the period of time during which an adverse event has a constant severity (or, sometimes, other properties). In this approach, a single medical condition may be represented by multiple AE records (see AE Example 4), each with a start and end date, and FA records with a test of severity would not be applicable. Another common practice is to define an adverse event as the whole of a medical condition, even if se verity (and other properties) change over time. With this approach, FA records may be used to represent data about severity (or other properties) of the adverse event that have timing different from the m edical condition as a whole. A finding that is about part of an event, rather than the event as a whole, meets this criterion for the use of FA. An assessment of an event that is not about the whole of an event may be a \"snapshot,\" an assessment at a point in time, or a \"slice,\" an assessment over a period of time (i.e., evaluation interval) during the event. In Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions , Example 1 shows snapshot assessments at 3 points in time. The timing variables used to represent a snapshot assessment generally include FADTC, along with visit and time point variables as applicable, but not FAEVLINT or FAE VINTX. FA Example 5 shows assessments over 24 - hour slices of the event. Slice assessments use an evaluation interval, so the timing variables used would generally include FADTC and either FAEVLINT or FAEVINTX.",

For example, if severity of an AE is collected at scheduled time points (e.g., per visit) throughout the duration of the AE, as in Section 6.4.4., Finding s About Events or Interventions , Example 6, the severities have timing that are different from that of the AE as a whole. Instead, the collected severities represent sna pshots or slices of the AE over time. Occasionally, data collection will include questi ons about the occurrence of prespecified events which are of naturally short duration, so that even though the assessments ar e repeated during the study, each assessment will provide information about an event as a whole. These type of assessments can be r epresented in the Events domain.

All rights res erved Page 362 2021 - 11 - 29 A finding which is a summary of multiple occurrences of a particular kind of event meets this criterion. For example, the number of episodes of vomiting during a particular time period is a finding about vomit ing. For events that have not ended at the time of an assessment, \"event as a whole\" means the event up to the time of the assessment. An event need not have ended for information about the event to be considered information about the event as a whole. Dat a about medical conditions collected before start of study treatment are usually about the event as a whole and are usually represented in Medical History (MH). See Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Intervention s , Example 3. Assessments of parts of events (snapshots or slices) are represented in FA and may or may not have parent records (e.g., FA Example 5). If the FA dataset is split by parent domain, the sponsor must decide which Events domain would have held a parent record for a parent - less FA record. A sponsor may consider that symptoms of the disease under study would be considered clinical events represented in the CE domain, so that FA records for symptoms of the disease under study would be in the F ACE split of the FA domain.

When there is a change in dosing or other characteri stics during the series, the most appropriate solution may be to represent the series of individual administrations in 2 records, one for the administrations before the change and a second for administrations after the change, rather than to create finding s about records. Criterion 2: An observation about an event or intervention which requires more than 1 variable for its representation, particularly when the observation may be represented with Findings class variables (e.g., units, method) The need to rep resent data which require more than 1 variable in a findings about structure, rather than by adding 2 or more supplemental qualifiers to an Events or Interventions domain, is driven by the fact that each supplemental qualifier is in a separate record that links only to the parent record. For example, if the size of a rash is measured, then the result and measurement unit (e.g., centimeters, inches) can be represented in an FA domain in a single record; other information regarding the rash (e.g., start and e nd times) would, if collected, appear in an Event record. See, for example, the longest diameter measurements in Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions , Example 2. Criterion 3: Data or information that indicate the occurrence of pre - specified AEs Every record in the AE domain must represent an event that actually occurred. Therefore, AE probing questions that are answered in the negative (e.g., did not occur, unknown, not done) cannot be stored in the AE domain. All answers to probing questions about the occurrence of pre - specified adverse events can be stored in the FA domain. (See Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions , Example 4.) For each \"Y\" respo nse to a probing question there should be a record in the AE domain. The FA record and the AE record may be linked via RELREC. The responses to all AE occurrence questions — whether \"Y\", \"N\", or \"NOT DONE\" — are represented in FAAE. This approach supports summ arization of incidence directly from the FA dataset.",

Data that can be represented in an event or intervention record, particularly data for which standard varia bles exist, should be represented in the appropriate Event or Intervention domain, even if the record is sparse. The absence of a \"parent\" event or intervention record does not prevent representing data about an event or intervention in an FA dataset. One situation that previously used this criterion was the collection of a diagnosis date or symptom onset date for the disease under study when the occurrence of the disease was collected in an inclusion criterion, rather than as medical history. That situatio n can now be represented in an MH record that includes MHEVDTYP. Events identified during a physical examination would, in accordance with CDASH best practices, be recorded in medical history or adverse events CRFs. Previous versions of the SDTMIG included the criterion, \"Data or information about an Event or Intervention that indicate the occurrence of related symptoms or therapies.\" This criterion has been removed because information about related symptoms or therapies is more appropriately represented as information about those symptoms or therapies rather than as information about the event or intervention to which they are thought be related.

Points to Consider The choice between representing a data item as a supplemental qualifier or as a finding about an event or intervention may not be clear - cut. The following questions may help in making a decision. • Does the d ata item have its own timing, separate from the timing of the event or intervention? If the data item represents some action during or after the event or intervention, it may be considered to have its own timing, and meet Criterion 1. o If the event or inter vention is a disease milestone, then RELMIDS is not included in this event or intervention record. Is the relationship of a data item to the disease milestone (RELMIDS) needed? If so, it can be represented in FA, but not as a supplemental qualifier to the parent record. • Are there several items which would be clearer if they could be grouped together? If so, the FA structure allows the use of FAGRPID, FACAT, or FASCAT to group the items. • Is the data item alone in a particular study, but related to other data items likely to be collected in other studies? If so, it may be preferable to represent the item in FA, where other FA variables might be needed for related items in the future. For example, the response to \"Was a rechallenge conducted?\" might be represen ted as a supplemental qualifier, but if additional information about the rechallenge (e.g, When?, What was the result?) were collected, then the FA structure would be needed. • Are there multiple evaluators for a data item that could otherwise be represented as a supplemental qualifier? If so, FA may provided a clearer representation of the multiple opinions, and would also allow the use of FAEVALID.",

A single FA domain, perhaps separated with different FACAT and/or FASCAT values 2. A split FA domain following the guidance in Section 4.1.7, Splitting Domains : o The DOMAIN value would be “FA”. o Variables that require a prefix would use “FA”. o The dataset names would be the domain name plus up to 2 additional characters indicating the parent domain (e.g., FACE for Findings About Clinical Events, FAMH for Findings About Medical History).

See Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions ; and Section 8.6.3, Guidelines for Differentiating Between Interventions, Events, Findings, and Findings About Events or Interventions ; for guidance on deciding between the use of the FA domain and other SDTM structures. 3. See Section 6.4.2, Naming Findings About Domains , for advice on splitting the FA domain. 4. Some variables in the events and interventions domains (e.g., OCCUR, SEV, TOXGR) represent find ings about the whole of the event or intervention. When FA is used to represent findings about a part of the event or intervention (i.e., the assessment has different timing fr om the event as a whole), the FATEST and FATESTCD values should be the same as t he variable name and variable label in the corresponding event or intervention domain.

The Skin Response (SR) domain is used to represent findings about an intervention, but it has its own domain code, SR, rather than the domain code FA. 2. This domain is intended specifically for tests of the immune response to substances that are intended to provoke such a respo nse (e.g., allergens used in allergy testing). SR is not intended for other injection - site reactions, including reactogencity events that may follow a vaccine administration.

Because a subject is typically exposed to many test materials at the same time, SROBJ is needed to rep resent the test material for each response record. The method of assessment could be a skin - prick test, a skin - scratch test, or other method of introducing the challenge substance into the skin. 4. Any Identifier variables, Timing variables, or Findings gener al observation class qualifiers may be added to the SR domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: -- POS, -- BODSYS, -- ORNRLO, -- ORNRHI, -- STNRLO, -- STNRHI, -- STNRC, -- NRIND, -- RESCAT, -- XFN, -- LOINC, -- SPCCND, -- FAST, -- TOX, -- TOXGR, -- SEV.

The subject was given an intradermal injection of standard tuberculin PPD (i.e., PPD - S) in the left forearm at visit 1; see the Procedure Agents (AG) record below. At visit 2, the induration diameter and presen ce of blistering were recorded. Because the tuberc ulin PPD skin test cannot be interpreted using the induration diameter and blistering alone (e.g., risk for being infected with TB must also be considered ), the interpretation of the skin test resides in its own row. The time point variables show that the planned time for reading the test was 48 hours after Mantoux administration. However, a comparison of datetime values in SRDT C and SRRFTDTC shows that in this case the test was read at 53 hours and 56 minutes after Mantoux administration. Row 1: Shows the longest diameter in millimeters of the induration after receiving an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL containing 5TU of PPD - S in the left forearm.

See the CDISC Glossary ( https://www.cdisc.org/standards/glossary ) for more complete definitions of clinical trial and objective. Concept Definition Trial design The design of a clinical trial is a plan for what will be done to subjects and what data will be collected about them, in the course of the trial, to address the trial's objectives. Epoch As part of the design of a trial, the planned period of subjects' participation in the trial is divided into epochs. Each epoch is a period of time that serves a purpose in the trial as a whole. That purpose will be at the level of the primary objectives of the trial. Typically, the purpose of an epoch will be to expose subjects to a treatment or to prepare for such a treatment period (e.g., determine subject eligibility, washout previous treatments), or to gather data on subjects after a treatment has ended. Note that at this high level, a “tr eatment” is a treatment strategy, which may be simple (e.g., exposure to a single drug at a single dose) or complex. Complex treatment strategies could involve tapering through several doses, titrating dose according to clinical criteria, complex regimens involving multiple drugs, or strategies for adding or dropping drugs according to clinical criteria. Arm An arm is a planned path through the trial. This path covers the entire time of the trial. The group of subjects assigned to a planned path is also of ten colloquially called an \"arm.\" The group of subjects assigned to an arm is also often called a \"treatment group\"; in this sense, an arm is equivalent to a treatment group. Study cell Each planned path through the trial (i.e., each arm) is divided into pieces, 1 for each epoch. Each of these pieces is called a study cell . Thus, there is a study cell for each combination of arm and epoch. Each study cell represents an implementation of the purpose of its associated epoch. For an epoch whose purpose is to expose subjects to treatment, each study cell associated with the epoch has an associated treatment strategy. For example, a 3 - arm parallel trial might have a treatment epoch whose purpose is to expose subjects to one of 3 study treatments: placebo, invest igational product, or active control.",

CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights res erved Page 383 2021 - 11 - 29 Concept Definition Element An element is a basic building block in the trial design. It invol ves administering a planned intervention, which may be treatment or no treatment, during a period of time. Elements for which the planned intervention is \"no treatment\" would include elements for screening, washout, and follow - up. Study cells and elements Many (perhaps most) clinical trials involve a single, simple administration of a planned intervention within a study cell. For some trials, however, the treatment strategy associated with a study cell involves a complex series of administrations of treatm ent. In such cases it may be important to track the component steps in a treatment strategy operationally; secondary objectives and safety analyses also might require that data be grouped by the treatment step during which it was collected. The steps withi n a treatment strategy may involve different doses of drug, different drugs, or different kinds of care (e.g., preoperative, operative, and post - operative periods surrounding surgery). When the treatment strategy for a study cell is simple, the study cell will contain a single element, and for many purposes there is little value in distinguishing between the study cell and the element. However, when the treatment strategy for a study cell consists of a complex series of treatments, a study cell can contain multiple elements. There may be a fixed sequence of elements, or a repeating cycle of elements, or some other complex pattern. In these cases, the distinction between a study cell and an element is very useful. Branch In a trial with multiple arms, the pr otocol plans for each subject to be assigned to 1 arm. The time within the trial at which this assignment takes place is the point at which the arm paths of the trial diverge, and so is called a branch point .",

      "content": "For many trials, the assignment to an arm happe ns all at one time, so the trial has 1 branch point. For other trials, there may be 2 or more branches that collectively assign a subject to an arm. The process that makes this assignment may be a randomization, but it need not be. Treatments The word \"tr eatment\" may be used in connection with epochs, study cells, or elements, but has somewhat different meanings in each context: • Because epochs cut across arms, an epoch treatment is at a high level that does not specify anything that differs between arms. For example, in a 3 - period crossover study of 3 doses of drug X, each treatment epoch is associated with drug X, but not with a specific dose. • A study cell treatment is specific to a particular arm. For example, a parallel trial might have study cell treatments placebo and drug X, without any additional detail (e.g., dose, frequency, route of administration) being specified. A study cell treatment is at a relatively high level, the level at which treatments might be planned in an early conceptual draf t of the trial, or in the title or objectives of the trial. • An element treatment may be fairly detailed. For example, for an element representing a cycle of chemotherapy, element treatment might specify 5 daily 100 mg doses of drug X. The distinctions betw een these levels are not rigid, and depend on the objectives of the trial. For example, route is generally a detail of dosing, but in a bioequivalence trial comparing IV and oral administration of drug X, route is clearly part of study cell treatment. Vis it The notion of a visit — a clinical encounter — derives from trials with outpatients, where subjects interact with the investigator during visits to the investigator's clinical site. However, the term is used in other trials, where a trial visit may not corr espond to a physical visit. For example, in a trial with inpatients, time may be subdivided into visits, even though subjects are in hospital throughout the trial. For example, data for a screening visit may be collected over the course of more than 1 phys ical visit. One of the main purposes of visits is the performance of assessments, but not all assessments need take place at clinic visits; some assessments may be performed by means of telephone contacts, electronic devices, or call - in systems. The protoc ol should specify what contacts are considered visits and how they are defined.",

Req 1 In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist valu es are enclosed in parentheses. TA – Assumptions 1. TAETORD is an integer. In general, the value of TAETORD is 1 for the first element in each arm, 2 for the second element in each arm, and so on. Occasionally, it may be convenient to skip some values (see Example Trial 6). Although the values of TAETORD need not always be sequential, their order must always be the correct order for the elements in the arm path. 2. Elements in different arms with the same value of TAETORD may or may not be at the same time, depending on the design of the trial. The example trials illustrate a variety of possible situations. The same element may occur more than once within an arm. 3. TABRANCH describes the outcome of a branch decision point in the trial design for subjects in the arm. A branch decision point takes place between epochs, and is ass ociated with the element that ends at the decision point. For instance, if subjects are assigned to an arm where they receive treatment A through a randomization at the end of element X, the value of TABRANCH for element X would be \"Randomized to A.\" 4. Branc h decision points may be based on decision processes other than randomizations (e.g., clinical evaluations of disease response, subject choice). 5. There is usually some gap in time between the performance of a randomization and the start of randomized treatm ent. However, in many trials this gap in time is small and it is highly unlikely that subjects will leave the trial between randomization and treatment. In these circumstances, the trial does not need to be modeled with this time period between randomizati on and start of treatment as a separate element. 6. Some trials include multiple paths that are closely enough related so that they are all considered to belong to 1 arm. In general, this set of paths will include a \"complete\" path along with shorter paths th at skip some elements.",

EPOCH is no t strictly necessary for describing the sequence of elements in an arm path, but it is the conceptual basis for comparisons between arms and also provides a useful way to talk about what is happening in a blinded trial while it is blinded. During periods o f blinded treatment, blinded participants will not know which arm and element a subject is in, but EPOCH should provide a description of the time period that does not depend on knowing arm. 9. EPOCH should be assigned in such a way that elements from different arms with the same value of EPOCH are \"comparable\" in some sense. The degree of similarity across arms varies considerably in different trials, as illustrated in the examples. 10. EPOCH values for multiple similar epochs: a. When a study design include s multiple epochs with the same purpose (e.g., multiple similar treatment epochs), it is recommended that the EPOCH values be terms from controlled terminology, but with numbers appended. For example, multiple treatment epochs could be represented using \"T REATMENT 1\", \"TREATMENT 2\", and so on. Because the codelist is extensible, this convention allows multiple similar epochs to be represented without adding numbered terms to the CDISC Controlled Terminology for epoch. The inclusion of multiple numbered ter ms in the EPOCH codelist is not considered to add value. b. Note that the controlled terminology does include some more granular terms for distinguishing between epochs that differ in ways other than mere order, and these terms should be used where applicable, as they are more informative. For example, when \"BLINDED TREATMENT\" and \"OPEN LABEL TREATMENT\" are applicable, those terms would be preferred over \"TREATMENT 1\" and \"TREATMENT 2\". 11.

For instance, in a crossover trial with 3 treatment epochs, each must be given a distinct name; all 3 cannot be called “TREATMENT”. TA – Examples The core of the Trial Design Model is the TA dataset. For each arm of the trial, the TA dataset contains 1 record for each occurrence of an element in the path of the arm. Although the TA dataset has 1 record for each trial element traversed by subjects assigned to the arm, it is generally more useful to work out the overall design of the trial at the study cell level first, then to work out the elements within each study cell, and finally to develop the definitions of the elements that are contained in t he Trial Elements (TE) table. When working out the design of a trial, it is generally useful to draw diagrams such as those mentioned in ICH E3. The protocol may include a diagram that can serve as a starting point. Such a diagram can then be converted int o a trial design matrix that displays the study cells and which in turn can be converted into the TA dataset. This section uses example trials of increasing complexity to illustrate the concepts of trial design. For each example trial, the process of worki ng out the TA table is illustrated by means of a series of diagrams and tables, including: • A diagram showing the branching structure of the trial in a “study schema” format such as might appear in a protocol • A diagram that shows the “prospective” view of t he trial (i.e., the view of those participating in the trial). This is similar to the study schema view in that it usually shows a single pool of subjects at the beginning of the trial, with the pool of subjects being split into separate treatment groups a t randomizations and other branches. Such diagrams include the epochs of the trial, and, for each group of subjects and each epoch, the sequence of elements within each epoch for that treatment group. The arms are also indicated on these diagrams. • A diagra m that shows the “retrospective” view of the trial (i.e., the view of the analyst reporting on the trial).",

In this type of document, diagrams are drawn using \"blocks\" corresponding to trial elements rather than horizontal lines. Trial elements are the various treatment and non - treatment time periods of the trial and we want to emphasize the separate trial elements might otherwise be \"hidden\" in a single horizontal line. See Section 7.2.2, Trial Elements (TE) , for more information about defining trial elements. In general, the elements of a trial will be fairly clear. However, in the process of working out a trial design, alternative definitions of trial elements m ay be considered, in which case diagrams for each alternative may be constructed. In the study schema diagrams in this example, the only slanting lines used are those that represent branches (i.e., decision points where subjects are divided into separate t reatment groups).

TABRANCH is populated on ly if there is a branch at the end of an element for the arm. When TABRANCH is populated, it describes how the decision at the branch point would result in a subject being in this arm. ta.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN ARMCD ARM TAETORD ETCD ELEMENT TABRANCH TATRA NS EPOCH 1 EX1 TA P Placebo 1 SCRN Screen SCREENING 2 EX1 TA P Placebo 2 RI Run - In Randomized to Placebo RUN - IN 3 EX1 TA P Placebo 3 P Placebo TREATMENT 4 EX1 TA A A 1 SCRN Screen SCREENING 5 EX1 TA A A 2 RI Run - In Randomized to Drug A RUN - IN 6 EX1 TA A A 3 A Drug A TREATMENT 7 EX1 TA B B 1 SCRN Screen SCREENING 8 EX1 TA B B 2 RI Run - In Randomized to Drug B RUN - IN 9 EX1 TA B B 3 B Drug B TREATMENT Example 2 The following diagram for a crossover trial does not use the crossing slanted lines sometimes used to represent crossover trials, because the order of the blocks is sufficient to represent the design of the trial.",

As for most crossover studies, the objectives of the trial will be addressed by comparisons between the arms and by within - subje ct comparisons between treatments. Because the design depends on differentiating the periods during which the subject receives the 3 different treatments, there are 3 different treatment epochs. The fact that the rest periods are identified as separate epo chs suggests that these also play an important part in the design of the trial; they are probably designed to allow subjects to return to “baseline,” with data collected to show that this occurred. Note that epochs are not considered reusable; each epoch h as a different name, even though all the treatment epochs are similar and both the rest epochs are similar.

Note that, in spite of the repeating element structure, this is, at its core, a 2 - arm parallel study, and thus has 2 arms. In SDTMIG 3.1.1, there was an implicit assumption that each element must be in a separate epoch, and trials with cyclical chemotherapy were difficult to handle. The introduction of the concept of study cells and the dropping of the assumption that elements and epoch s have a one - to - one relationship resolved these difficulties. This trial is best treated as having just 3 epochs, since the main objectives of the trial involve comparisons between the 2 treatments and do not require data to be considered cycle by cycle.

Example Trial 4, Cyclical Chemotherapy Retrospective View For the purpose of developing a TA dataset for this oncology trial, the diagram must be redrawn to explicitly represent multiple treatment and rest elements. If a maximum number of cycles is not given by the protocol, then — for the purposes of constructing an SDTM TA dataset for submission, which can only take place after the t rial is complete — the number of repeats included in the TA dataset should be the maximum number of repeats that occurred in the trial. The next diagram assumes that the maximum number of cycles that occurred in this trial was 4. Some subjects will not have received all 4 cycles, because their disease progressed. The rule that directed that they receive no further cycles of chemotherapy is represented by a set of green arrows, 1 at the end of each rest epoch, that shows that a subject “skips forward” if their disease progresses. In the TA dataset, each skip - forward instruction is a transition rule, recorded in the TATRANS variable; when TATRANS is not populated, the rule is to transition to the next element in sequence.

In such a case, epochs are likely to be defined as broad inte rvals of time, spanning several elements, and chosen to correspond to periods of time that will be compared in analyses of the trial.

Branch rules represent forks in the trial flowchart, giving rise to separate arms. The rule underlying a branch in the trial design appears in mul tiple records, once for each \"fork\" of the branch. Within any one record, there is no choice (no \"if\" clause) in the value of the branch condition. For example, the value of TABRANCH for a record in arm A is \"Randomized to Arm A\" because a subject in arm A must have been randomized to arm A. Transition rules are used for choices within an arm. The value for TATRANS does contain a choice (an \"if\" clause). In Example Trial 4, subjects who receive 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles of treatment A are all considered to belon g to arm A. In modeling a trial, decisions may have to be made about whether a decision point in the flow chart represents the separation of paths that represent different arms, or paths that represent variations within the same arm, as illustrated in the discussion of Example Trial 7. This decision will depend on the comparisons of interest in the trial. Some trials refer to groups of subjects who follow a particular path through the trial as \"cohorts,\" particularly if the groups are formed successively over time. The term \"cohort\" is used with different meanings in different protocols and does not always correspond to an arm. Subjects Not Assigned to an Arm Some trial subjects may drop out of the study before they reach all of the branch poi nts in the trial design. In the Demographics (DM) domain, the values of ARM and ARMCD must be supplied for such subjects, but the special values used for these subjects should not be included in the Trial Arms (TA) dataset; only complete arm paths should b e described in the TA dataset. In Section 5.2, Demographics , assumption 4 describes special ARM and ARMCD values used for subjects who do not reach the first branch point in a trial. When a trial design includes 2 or m ore branches, special values of ARM and ARMCD may be needed for subjects who pass through the first branch point, but drop out before the final branch point. See DM Example 3 for how to represent ARM and ARMCD values for such trials.

All rights res erved Page 403 2021 - 11 - 29 The Trial Elements (TE) dataset contains the definitions of the elements that appear in the Trial Arms (TA) dataset. An element may appear multiple times in the TA table because it appears either (1) in multiple arms, (2) multiple times within an arm, or (3) both. However, an element will appear only once in the TE table. Each row in the TE dataset may be thought of as representing a \"unique element\" in the same sense of \"unique\" as a CRF template page for a collecting certain type of data referre d to as \"unique page.\" For instance, a CRF might be described as containing 87 pages, but only 23 unique pages. By analogy, the trial design matrix in Example Trial 1 (see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms ) has 9 study cells, each of which contains 1 element, but the same trial design matrix contains only 5 unique elements, so the TE dataset for that trial has only 5 records. An element is a building block for creating study cells, and an arm is composed of study cells. Or, fr om another point of view, an arm is composed of elements; that is, the trial design assigns subjects to arms, which comprise a sequence of steps called elements. Trial elements represent an interval of time that serves a purpose in the trial and are associ ated with certain activities affecting the subject. “Week 2 to week 4” is not a valid element. A valid element has a name that describes the purpose of the element and includes a description of the activity or event that marks the subject's transition into the element as well as the conditions for leaving the element.

There are no gaps between elements. The instant one element ends, the next element begins. A subject spends no time “between” elements. 2. The ELEMENT (Description of the Element) variable usually indicates the treatment being administered during an element, or, if no treatment is being administered, the other activities that are the purpose of this period of time (e.g., \"Screening\" , \"Follow - up\", \"Washout\"). In some cases, this time period may be quite passive (e.g., \"Rest\"; \"Wait, for disease episode\"). 3. The TESTRL (Rule for Start of Element) variable identifies the event that marks the transition into this element. For elements that involve treatment, this is the start of treatment. 4. For elements that do not involve treatment, TESTRL can be more difficult to define. For washout and follow - up elements, which always follow treatment elements, the start of the element may be defined rela tive to the end of a preceding treatment. For example, a washout period might be defined as starting 24 or 48 hours after the last dose of drug for the preceding treatment element or epoch. This definition is not totally independent of the TA dataset, beca use it relies on knowing where in the trial design the element is used, and that it always follows a treatment element. Defining a clear starting point for the start of a non - treatment element that always follows another non - treatment element can be partic ularly difficult.

For example, every arm of a trial that involves treating disease episodes might start with a screening element followed by an element that co nsists of waiting until a disease episode occurs. The activity that marks the beginning of the wait element might be randomization. 5. TESTRL for a treatment element may be thought of as “active” whereas the start rule for a non - treatment element — particularly a follow - up or washout element — may be “passive.” The start of a treatment element will not occur until a dose is given, no matter how long that dose is delayed. Once the last dose is given, the start of a subsequent non - treatment element is inevitable, as long as another dose is not given. 6. Note that the date/time of the event described in TESTRL will be used to populate the date/times in the Subject Elements (SE) dataset, so the date/time of the event should be captured in the CRF. 7. Specifying TESTRL for an element that serves the first element of an arm in the TA dataset involves defining the start of the trial. In the examples in this document, obtaining informed consent has been used as \"Trial Entry.\" 8. TESTRL should be expressed without referring to arm. I f the element appears in more than 1 arm in the TA dataset, then the element description (ELEMENT) must not refer to any arms. 9. TESTRL should be expressed without referring to epoch. If the element appears in more than 1 epoch in the TA dataset, then the El ement description (ELEMENT) must not refer to any epochs. 10. For a blinded trial, it is useful to describe TESTRL in terms that separate the properties of the event that are visible to blinded participants from the properties that are visible only to those wh o are unblinded. For treatment elements in blinded trials, wording such as the following is suitable: \"First dose of study drug for a treatment epoch, where study drug is X.\" 11. Element end rules are rather different from element start rules. The actual end o f one element is the beginning of the next element. Thus, the element end rule does not give the conditions under which an element does end, but the conditions under which it should end or is planned to end. 12.

For instance, a typical criterion for ending a rest element between oncology chemotherapy - treatment element would be, “15 days after start of element and after WBC values have recovered.\" The TA dataset, not the TE dataset, describes where the subject moves next, so TEENRL must be expressed without referring to arm. 14. TEDUR serves the same purpos e as TEENRL for the special (but very common) case of an element with a fixed duration. TEDUR is expressed in ISO 8601. For example, a TEDUR value of P6W is equivalent to a TEENRL of \"6 weeks after the start of the element.\" 15. Note that elements that have different start and end rules are different elements and must have different values of ELEMENT and ETCD. For instance, elements that involve the same treatment but have different durations are different elements. The same applies to non - treatment elem ents. For instance, a washout with a fixed duration of 14 days is different from a washout that is to end after 7 days if drug cannot be detected in a blood sample, or after 14 days otherwise. TE – Examples Both of the trials in TA Examples 1 and 2 (see Se ction 7.2.1, Trial Arms ) are assumed to have fixed - duration elements. The wording in TESTRL is intended to separate the description of the event that starts the element into the part that would be visible to a blinded participant in the trial (e.g., \"First dose of a treatment epoch\") from the part that is revealed when the study is unblinded (e.g., \"where dose is 5 mg\"). Care must be taken in choosing these descriptions to be sure that they are arm - and epoch - neutral. For instance, in a crossover trial such as TA Example Trial 3, where an element may appear in 1 of multiple epochs, the wording must be appropriate for all possible epochs (e.g., \"OPEN LABEL TREATMENT\"). The SDS Team is considering adding a separate variab le to the TE dataset that would hold information on the treatment that is associated with an element. This would make it clearer which elements are \"treatment elements” and, therefore, which epochs contain treatment elements and thus are \"treatment Epochs. \" CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc.

TA Example Trial 2 was represented using 3 treatment epochs separated by 2 washout epochs and followed by a follow - up epoch. This might have been modeled using 3 treatment epochs that included both the 2 - week treatment period and the 1 - week rest period. Because the first week after the third treatment period would be included in the third treatment epoch, the follow - up epoch would then have a duration of 2 weeks. 2. In TA Example Trials 4, 5, and 6, separate treatment and rest elements were identified. However, the combination of treatment and rest could be represented as a single element. 3. A trial might include a dose titration, with subjects receiving increasing doses on a weekly basis until certain condition s are met. The trial design could be modeled in any of the following ways: a. Using several 1 - week elements at specific doses, followed by an element of variable length at the chosen dose CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc.

The choice of elements used to represent this dose titration will depend on the objectives of the trial and how the data will be analyzed and reported. If it is important to exami ne side effects or lab values at each individual dose, the first model is appropriate. If it is important only to identify the time to completion of titration, the second model might be appropriate. If the titration process is routine and is of little inte rest, the third model might be adequate for the purposes of the trial. Distinguishing Elements, Study Cells, and Epochs It is easy to confuse elements, which are reusable trial building blocks, with study cells (which contain the elements for a particular epoch and Arm) and with epochs (which are time periods for the trial as a whole). In part, this is because many trials have epochs for which the same element appears in all arms. In other words, in the trial design matrix for many trials, there are columns (Epochs) in which all the study cells have the same contents.",

      "content": "It also is natural to use the same name (e.g., screen, follow - up) for both such an epoch and the single element that appears within it. Confusion can also arise from the fact that in the blinde d treatment portions of blinded trials, blinded participants do not know which element a subject is in, but do know what epoch the subject is in. In describing a trial, one way to avoid confusion between elements and epochs is to include \"Element\" or \"Epoc h\" in the values of ELEMENT or EPOCH when these values (e.g., screening, follow - up) would otherwise be the same. It becomes tedious to do this in every case, but can be useful to resolve confusion when it arises or is likely to arise. The difference betwee n epoch and element is perhaps clearest in crossover trials. In TA Example Trial 2, as for most crossover tri als, the analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) results would include both treatment and period effects in the model. “Treatment effect” derives from ele ment (placebo, 5 mg, 10 mg), whereas “period effect” derives from the epoch (first, second, or third treatment epoch). Transitions Between Elements The transition between one element and the next can be thought of as a 3 - step process: Step Step question Ho w step question is answered by information in the TA datasets 1 Should the subject leave the current element? The criteria for ending the current element are in TEENRL in the TE dataset. 2 Which element should the subject enter next? If there is a branch point at this point in the trial, evaluate criteria described in TABRANCH (e.g., randomization results) in the TA dataset. Otherwise, if TATRANS in the TA dataset is populated in this arm at this point, follow those instructions. Otherwise, move to the next element in this arm as specified by TAETORD in the TA dataset. 3 What does the subject do to enter the next element? The action or event that marks the start of the next element is specified in TESTRL in the TE dataset. Note that the subject is not \"in limbo\" during this process. The subject remains in the current element until step 3, at which point the subject transitions to the new element. There are no gaps between elements.

Although the general structure of the Trial Visits (TV) dataset is \"One Record per Planned Visit per Arm,\" for many clinical trials — particularly blinded clinical trials — the schedule of visits is the same for all arms, and the structure of the TV dataset will be \"One Record per Planned Visit.\" If the schedule of visits is the same for all arms, ARMCD should be left blank for all records in the TV dataset. For trials with trial visits t hat are different for different arms (e.g., Example Trial 7 in Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms ), ARMCD and ARM should be populated for all records. If some visits are the same for all arms, and some visits differ by arm, th en ARMCD and ARM should be populated for all records, to ensure clarity, even though this will mean creating near - duplicate records for visits that are the same for all arms. 2. A visit may start in one element and end in another. This means that a visit may start in one epoch and end in another. For example, if one of the activities planned for a visit is the administration of the first dose of study drug, the visit might start in the screen epoch and end in a treatment epoch. 3. TVSTRL describes the scheduling of the visit and should reflect the wording in the protocol. In many trials, all visits are scheduled relative to the study's day 1 (RFSTDTC). In such trials, it is useful to include VISITDY, which is, in effect, a special case representation of TVSTRL. 4. Note that there is a subtle difference between the following 2 examples. In the first case, if visit 3 were delayed for some reason, visit 4 would be unaffected. In the second case, a delay to visit 3 would result in visit 4 being delayed as well. a.

      "content": "7.3.1.1 Trial Visits Issues Identifying Trial Visits In general, a trial's visits are defined in its protocol. The term “visit” reflects the fact that data in outpatient studies is usually collected during a physical visit by the subject to a clinic. Sometimes a trial visit defined by the protocol may not co rrespond to a physical visit. It may span multiple physical visits, as when screening data is collected over several clinic visits but recorded under one TV name (VISIT) and number (VISITNUM). A trial visit also CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model Implementation Guide: Human Clinical Trials (3.4 Final ) © 2021 Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Inc. All rights res erved Page 410 2021 - 11 - 29 may represent only a portion of an extended physical visit, as when a trial of in - patients collects data under multiple trial visits for a single hospital admission. Diary data and other data collected outside a clinic may not fit the usual concept of a trial visit, but the planned times of collecti on of such data may be described as “visits” in the TV dataset if desired. Trial Visit Rules Visit start rules are different from element start rules in that they usually describe when a visit should occur; element start rules describe the moment at which an element is considered to start. There are usually gaps between visits, periods of time that do not belong to any visit, so it is usually not necessary to identify the moment when one visit stops and another starts. However, some trials of hospitalized s ubjects may divide time into visits in a manner more like that used for elements, and a transition event may need to be defined in such cases. Visit start rules are usually expressed relative to the start or end of an element or epoch (e.g., \"1 - 2 hours bef ore end of First Wash - out\", \"8 weeks after end of 2nd Treatment Epoch\"). Note that the visit may or may not occur during the element used as the reference for the visit start rule. For example, a trial with elements based on treatment of disease episodes m ight plan a visit 6 months after the start of the first treatment period, regardless of how many disease episodes have occurred. Visit end rules are similar to element end rules, describing when a visit should end. They may be expressed relative to the sta rt or end of an element or epoch, or relative to the start of the visit. The timings of visits relative to elements may be expressed in terms that cannot be easily quantified.",

This baseline visit is thus started and ended before the start of the treatment epoch, but we don't know how long before the start of the treatment epoch the visit will occur. The trial start rule might contain the value \"On the day of, but before, the start of the Treatment Epoch\". Visit Schedules Expressed with Ranges Ranges may be used to describe the planned timing of visits (e.g., 12 - 16 days after the start of 2nd Element), but this is different from the “windows” that may be used in selecting data points to be included in an analysis associated with that visit. For example, although visit 2 was planned for 12 - 16 days after the start of treatment, data collected 10 - 18 days after the start of treatment might be included in a visit 1 analysis. The 2 ranges serve different purposes. Contingent Visits Some data collection is contingent on the occurrence of a \"trigger\" event or disease milestone (see Section 7.3.3, Trial Disease Milestones (TM) ). When such planne d data collection involves an additional clinic visit, a \"contingent\" visit may be included in the TV table, with a rule that describes the circumstances under which it will take place. Because values of VISITNUM must be assigned to all records in the TV d ataset, a contingent visit included in the TV dataset must have a VISITNUM, but the VISITNUM value might not be a \"chronological\" value, due to the uncertain timing of a contingent visit. If contingent visits are not included in the TV dataset, then they w ould be treated as unplanned visits in the Subject Visits (SV) domain (see Section 6.2.8, Subject Visits ).",

Req 1 In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. TD – Assumptions 1. The purpose of the Trial Disease Assessments (TD) domain is to provide information on planned scheduling of disease assessments when the scheduling of disease assessment s is not necessarily tied to the scheduling of visits. In oncology studies, good compliance with the disease - assessment schedule is essential to reduce the risk of \"assessment time bias.\" The TD domain makes possible an evaluation of assessment time bias f rom the SDTM, in particular for studies with progression - free survival (PFS) endpoints. TD has limited utility within oncology and was developed specifically with RECIST in mind and where an assessment - time bias analysis is appropriate. It is understood th at extending this approach to Cheson and other criteria may not be appropriate or may pose difficulties. It is also understood that this approach may not be necessary in non - oncology studies, although it is available for use if appropriate. 2. A planned sched ule of assessments will have a defined start point; the TDANCVAR variable is used to identify the variable in the ADaM subject - level dataset (ADSL) that holds the “anchor” date. By default, the anchor variable for the first pattern is ANCH1DT. An anchor da te must be provided for each pattern of assessments, and each anchor variable must exist in ADSL. TDANCVAR is therefore a Required variable. Anchor date variable names should adhere to ADaM variable naming conventions (e.g. ANCH1DT, ANCH2DT). One anchor da te may be used to anchor more than 1 pattern of disease assessments. When that is the case, the appropriate offset for the start of a subsequent pattern, represented as an ISO 8601 duration value, should be provided in the TDSTOFF variable.",

If the pattern of disease assessments does not start exactly on a date collected on the CRF, this variable will represent the offset between the anchor date value and the start date of the pattern of disease assessments. This may be a positive or zero interval value represented in an ISO 8601 format.

A pattern of assessments consists of a series of intervals of equal duration, each followed by an assessment. Thus, the first assessment in a pattern is planned to occur at the anchor date (given by the variable named in TDANCVAR) plus the offset (TDSTOFF) plus the target assessment interval (TDTGTPAI). A baseline evaluation is usually not preceded by an interval, and would therefore not be considered part of an assessment pattern. 5.

Note that there is an upper and lower limit around the planned disease assessment target where the first assessment (8 weeks) could occur as early as day 53 and as late as week 9. This upper and lower limit ( - 3 days, +1 week) would be applied to all assessments during that pattern. • The second disease assessment schedule starts from week 48 an d repeats every 12 weeks for a total of 4 repeats (i.e., week 60, week 72, week 84, week 96), with respective upper and lower limits of - 1 week and + 1 week.",

The Trial Summary (TS) dataset allows the sponsor to submit a summary of the trial in a structured format. Each record in the TS dataset contains the value of a parameter, a characteristic of the trial. For example, TS is used to record b asic information about the study such as trial phase, protocol title, and trial objectives. The TS dataset contains information about the planned and actual trial characteristics. TS – Specification ts .xpt, Trial Summary — Trial Design.

The intent of this dataset is to provide a summary of trial information. This is not subject - level data. 2. Recipients may specify their requirements for which trial summary parameters should be included under which circumstances. For example, the US FDA includes such information in their Study Data Technical Conformance Guide . 3. The order of parameters in the exa mples of TS datasets should not be taken as a requirement. There are no requirements or expectations about the order of parameters within the TS dataset. 4. The method for treating text >200 characters in TS is similar to that used for the Comments (CO) speci al - purpose domain (Section 5.1, Comments ). If TSVAL is >200 characters, then it should be split into multiple variables, TSVAL - TSVAL n . See Section 4.5.3.2, Text Strings Greater t han 200 Characters in Other Variables . 5. A list of values for TSPARM and TSPARMCD can be found in CDISC Controlled Terminology, available at https://www.cancer.gov/research/resources /terminology/cdisc. 6. Controlled terminology for TSPARM is extensible. The meaning of any added parameters should be explained in the metadata for the TS dataset. 7. For a particular trial summary parameter, responses (values in TSVAL) may be numeric, datetimes or amounts of time represented in ISO8601 format, or text.",

      "content": "For some parameters, textual responses may be taken from controlled terminology; for others, responses may be free text. 8. For some trial summary parameters, CDISC Controlled Terminology includes co delists for use with TSVAL. The associations between trial summary parameters and response codelists are in the TS codetable, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/te rminology/controlled - terminology . Recipients may also specify controlled terminology for TSVAL. These specifications may be for trial summary parameters for which there is no CDISC Controlled Terminology or they may replace CDISC Controlled Terminology for a trial summary parameter. For example, the US FDA Data Standards Catalog includes terminologies to be used for certain trial summary parameters. 9. There is a code value for TSVALCD only when there is controlled terminology for TSVAL. For example, when TSP ARMCD = \"PLANSUB\" (Planned Number of Subjects) or TSPARMCD = \"TITLE\" (Trial Title), then TSVALCD will be null. 10. TSVALNF contains a “null flavor,” a value that provides additional coded information when TSVAL is null. For example, for TSPARM = \"AGEMAX\" (Plan ned Maximum Age of Subjects), there is no value if a study does not specify a maximum age. In this case, the appropriate null flavor is \"PINF\", which stands for \"positive infinity.\" In a clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy volunteers for a dru g where indications are not yet established, the appropriate null flavor for TSPARM = \"INDIC\" (Trial Disease/Condition Indication) would be \"NA\" (i.e., not applicable). TSVALNF can also be used in a case where the value of a particular parameter is unknown .

Some codelists used for TSVAL include terms which are also null flavors. For example, the Pharmaceutical Dosage Form codelist includes the values \"UNKNOWN\" and \"NOT APPLICABLE\". In such cases, TSVAL should have the term from the codelist and TSVALNF shou ld be null. 12. For some trials, there will be multiple records in the TS dataset for a single parameter. For example, a trial that addresses both safety and efficacy could have 2 records with TSPARMCD = \"TTYPE\" (Trial Type), one with the TSVAL = \"SAFETY\" and the other with TSVAL = \"EFFICACY\".

TS does not contain subject - level data, so there is no restriction analogous to the requirement in subject - level datasets that the blocks bound by TSGRPID are within a subject. TSGRPID can be used to tie together any block of records in the dataset. TSGR PID is most likely to be used when the TS dataset includes multiple records for the same parameter. For example, if a trial compared administration of a total daily dose given once a day to that dose split over 2 administrations, the TS dataset might incl ude the following records. There are 2 records each for TSPARMCD = \"Dose\" and TSPARMCD = \"DOSFREQ\". Records with the same TSGRPID are associated with each other. In this example, dose units are the same for both administration schedules, so only 1 record for DOSU is needed.

If the protocol does not provide information about which objectives meet the definition of TSPARM = \"OBJPRIM\" (Trial Primary Objective; i.e., the principal purpose of the trial), then the objectives should be provided as values of TSPA RM = \"OBJPRIM\". Consult the controlled terminology for trial summary parameters for appropriate parameter values for representing other objective designations (e.g., secondary, exploratory). 15. As per the definitions, the primary outcome measure is associated with the primary objective, the secondary outcome measure is associated with the secondary objective, and the exploratory outcome measure is associated with the exploratory objective. It is possible for the same outcome measure to be associated with more than 1 objective. For example, 2 objectives could use the same outcome measure at different time points, or using different analysis methods. 16.

Trial indication: Values for TSVAL when TSPARMCD = \"INDIC\" would indicate the condition, disease, or disorder the trial is intended to investigate or address. A vaccine study of healthy subjects, with the intended purpose of preventing influenza infection, would have TSVAL = \"Influenza\". A clinical pharmacology study of healthy volunteers, with the purpose of collecting pharmacokinetic data, would have no trial indication; TSVAL would be null and TSVALNF = \"NA\" if TS conta ins a row where TSPARMCD = \"INDIC\". 18.

      "content": "7.4.2.1 Use of Null Flavor The variable TSVALNF is based on the idea of a “null flavor” as embodied in the ISO 21090 standard (Health Informatics – Harmonized data types for information exchange; https://www.iso.org/standard/35 646.html ). A null flavor is an ancillary piece of data that provides additional information when its primary piece of data is null (has a missing value). There is controlled terminology for the null flavor data item which includes such familiar values as \" Unknown\", \"Other\", and \"Not Applicable\" among its 14 terms. The proposal to include a null flavor variable to supplement the TSVAL variable in the Trial Summary Information (TS) dataset arose when it was realized that the TS model did not have a good way t o represent the fact that a protocol placed no upper limit on the age of study subjects. When the trial summary parameter is AGEMAX, then TSVAL should have a value expressed as an ISO 8601 time duration (e.g., P43Y for 43 years old, P6M for 6 months old). Although it would be possible to allow a value such as \"NONE\" or \"UNBOUNDED\" to be entered in TSVAL, validation programs would then have to recognize this special term as an exception to the expected data format. Therefore, the SDS team decided that a sepa rate null flavor variable that uses the ISO 21090 null - flavor terminology would be a better solution. The SDS Team also decided to specify the use of a null - flavor variable in the TS domain with SDTMIG v3.4 as a way of testing the use of such a variable in a limited setting. As the title of ISO 21090 suggests, that standard was developed for use with healthcare data; it is expected that it will eventually see wide use in the clinical data from which clinical trial data are derived. CDISC already uses this d ata - type standard (see BRIDG; https://www.cdisc.org/standards/ ). The null flavor, in particular, is a solution to the widespread problem of needing or wanting to convey information that will help in the interpretation of a missing value. Although null flavors could certainly be eventually used for this purpose in other cases (e.g., with subject data), doing so at this time would be extremely disruptive and premature. The use of null flavors for the variable TSVAL provides an opportunity for sponsors and reviewers to learn about the null flavors and to evaluate their usefulness in a concrete setting.",

The actual process of modeling a trial may depart from these numbered steps. Some steps will overlap; there may be several iterations; and not all steps are relevant for all studies. 1. Start from the flow chart or schema diagram usually included in the trial protocol. This diagram will show how many arms the trial has, and the branch poin ts or decision points where the arms diverge. 2. Write down the decision rule for each branching point in the diagram. Does the assignment of a subject to an arm depend on a randomization? On whether the subject responded to treatment? On some other criterion ? 3. If the trial has multiple branching points, check whether all the branches that have been identified really lead to different arms. The arms will relate to the major comparisons the trial is designed to address.

For each arm, identify the major time periods of treatment and non - treatment a subject assigned to that arm will go through. These are the elements, or building blocks, of which the arm is composed. 5. Define the starting point of each element. Define the rule for how long the element should last. Determine whether the element is of fixed duration. 6. Re - examine the sequences of elements that make up the variou s arms and consider alternative element definitions. Would it be better to “split” some elements into smaller pieces or “lump” some elements into larger pieces? Such decisions will depend on the aims of the trial and plans for analysis. 7. Compare the various arms. In most clinical trials, especially blinded trials, the pattern of elements will be similar for all arms, and it will make sense to define trial epochs. Assign names to these epochs. During the conduct of a blinded trial, it will not be known which arm a subject has been assigned to, or which treatment elements they are experiencing, but the epochs they are passing through will be known. 8.

All relationships make use of the standard domain identifiers STUDYID, DOMAIN, and USUBJID. In addition, the variables IDVAR and IDVARVAL are used for identifying the record - level merge/join keys. These keys are used to tie information together by linking records. The specific set of identifiers necessary to properly identify each type of relationship is described in detail in the following sections. The following are examples of va riables that could be used in IDVAR: • The sequence number ( -- SEQ) variable uniquely identifies a record for a given USUBJID within a domain. The variable -- SEQ is required in all domains except DM. For example, if a subject has 25 adverse events in the Adve rse Event (AE) domain, then 25 unique AESEQ values should be established for this subject. Conventions for establishing and maintaining -- SEQ values are sponsor - defined. Values may or may not be sequential depending on data processes and sources. • The refer ence identifier ( -- REFID) variable can be used to capture a sponsor - defined or external identifier, such as an identifier provided in an electronic data transfer.",

It is used to identify relationships between records within a USUBJID within a single domain (e.g., intervention records for a combination therapy where treatments in the combination varies from subject to subject). In such cases, the relationship is defined by assigning the same unique character value to the -- GRPID variable. The values used for -- GRPID can be any values the spon sor chooses; however, if the sponsor uses values with some embedded meaning (rather than arbitrary numbers), those values should be consistent across the submission to avoid confusion. It is important to note that -- GRPID has no inherent meaning across sub jects or across domains. Using -- GRPID in the general - observation class domains can reduce the number of records in the RELREC, SUPP -- , and CO datasets, when those datasets are submitted to describe relationships/associations for records or values to a \"gr oup\" of general observation class records. 8.1.1 -- GRPID Example The following table illustrates -- GRPID used in the Concomitant Medications (CM) domain to identify a combination therapy. In this example, both subjects 1234 and 5678 have reported 2 combination t herapies, each consisting of 3 separate medications. The components of a combination all have the same value for CMGRPID.

The value in IDVAR must be the name of the key used to merge/join the 2 datasets. In this example, the -- LNKID variable is used as the key to identify th e related observations. The values for the ‑‑ LNKID variable in the 2 datasets are sponsor - defined. Although other variables may also serve as a single merge key when the corresponding values for IDVAR are equal, -- GRPID, -- SPID, -- REFID, -- LNKID, or -- LNKG RP are typically used for this purpose. The variable RELTYPE identifies the type of relationship between the datasets. The allowable values are ONE and MANY (controlled terminology is expected). This information defines how a merge/join would be written, a nd what would be the result of the merge/join. The possible combinations are: 1. ONE and ONE. This combination indicates that there is NO hierarchical relationship between the datasets and the records in the datasets.

Therefore, the Supplemental Qualifiers special - purpose dataset model is used to capture non - standard variables (NSVs) and their association to parent records in general - observation class datasets (Even ts, Findings, Interventions), Demographics (DM), and Subject Visits (SV). Supplemental qualifiers are represented as separate SUPP -- datasets for each dataset containing sponsor - defined variables (see Section 8.4.2, S ubmitting Supplemental Qualifiers in Separate Datasets ). SUPP -- represents the metadata and data for each NSV/value combination. As the name suggests, this dataset is intended to capture additional qualifiers for an observation. Data that represent separat e observations should be treated as separate observations. The Supplemental Qualifiers dataset is structured similarly to the RELREC dataset, in that it uses the same set of keys to identify parent records. Each SUPP -- record also includes the name of the qualifier variable being added (QNAM), the label for the variable (QLABEL), the actual value for each instance or record (QVAL), the origin (QORIG) of the value (see Section 4.1.8, Origin Metadata ), and the evaluator ( QEVAL) to specify the role of the individual who assigned the value (e.g., \"ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE\", \"SPONSOR\").

An attribution is typically an interpretation or subjective classification of 1 or more observations by a specific evaluator, such as a flag that indicates whether an observation was c onsidered to be clinically significant. It is possible that different attributions may be necessary in some cases; SUPP -- provides a mechanism for incorporating as many attributions as are necessary.

For example, Demographics (DM) qualifie rs would be submitted in suppdm.xpt. When data have been split into multiple datasets (see Section 4.1.7, Splitting Domains ), longer names such as SUPPFAMH may be needed. In cases where data about associated persons ha ve been collected, supplemental qualifiers for Findings About events or interventions for an associated person may need to be represented (see the SDTMIG for Associated Persons, https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/ ).

STUDYID, USUBJID, and DOMAIN (with the value CO) must always be populated. RDOMAIN, IDVAR, and IDVARVAL should be populated as follows: 1. Comments related only to a subject in general (likely collected on a log - style CRF page/screen) would have RDOMAIN, IDVAR, IDVARVAL null, as the only key needed to identify the relationship/association to that subject is USUBJID. 2.

      "content": "8.6.1 Guidelines for Determining the General Observation Class Section 2.6, Creating a New Domain , discusses when to place data in an existing domain and how to create a new domain. A key part of the process of creating a new domain is determining whether an observation represents an event, an intervention, or a finding. Begin by considering the content of the information in the light of the def initions of the 3 general observation classes (see Section 2.3, The General Observation Classes ), rather than by trying to deduce the class from the information's physical structure; physical structure can sometimes be misleading. For example, from a structural standpoint, one might expect events observations to include a start and stop date. However, medical history data (data about previous conditions or events) is events data regardless of whether dates were collecte d. An intervention is something that is done to a subject (possibly by the subject) that is expected to have a physiological effect. This concept of intended effect makes interventions relatively easy to recognize, although there are gray areas around some testing procedures. For example, exercise stress tests are designed to produce and then measure certain physiological effects. The measurements from such a testing procedure are findings, although some aspects of the procedure might be modeled as interven tions. An event is something that happens to a subject spontaneously. Most, although not all, events data captured in clinical trials is about medical events. Because many medical events must, by regulation, be treated as adverse events, a new Events domai n will be created only for events that are clearly not adverse events; the existing Medical History (MH) and Clinical Events (CE) domains are the appropriate places to store most medical events that are not adverse events. Many aspects of medical events — in cluding tests performed to evaluate them, interventions that may have caused them, and interventions given to treat them — may be collected in clinical trials. Where to place data on assessments of events can be particularly challenging, and is discussed fur ther in Section 8.6.3, Guidelines for Differentiating Between Interventions, Events, Findings, and Findings About Events or Interventions . Findings general observation class data include measurements, tests, assessmen ts, or examinations performed on a subject in the clinical trial. These may be performed on the subject as a whole (e.g., height, heart rate), or on a specimen taken from a subject (e.g., blood sample, ECG tracing, tissue sample). Sometimes the relationshi p between a subject and a finding is less direct; a finding may be about an event that happened to the subject or an intervention received. Findings about events and interventions are discussed further in Section 8.6.3, Guidelines for Differentiating Between Interventions, Events, Findings, and Findings About Events or Interventions .",

This implementation guide shows examples of both. In some cases, a single data structure works well for a variety of types of data. For example, all questionnaire data are placed in the QS domain, with particular questionnaires identified by QSCAT (see Section 6.3.9, Qu estionnaires, Ratings, and Scales (QRS) Domains (FT, QS, RS) ). Although some operational databases may store urinalysis data in a separate dataset, the SDTM places all lab data in the LB domain (see Section 6.3.5.6, La boratory Test Results (LB) ) with urinalysis tests identified using LBSPEC. In other cases, a particular topic may be very broad and/or require more than 1 data structure (and therefore require more than 1 dataset). This implementation guide includes exampl es in microbiology and pharmacokinetics (see Section 6.3.5.7, Microbiology Domains , and Section 6.3.5.9, Pharmacokinetics Domains ).

The relations hip between interventions, findings, and findings about interventions would be handled similarly. The Findings About (FA) domain was initially created to represent findings about events, but can also be used for findings about interventions. This section d iscusses events and findings generally, but it is particularly useful for understanding the distinction between the Clinical Events (CE) and FA domains. There may be several sources of confusion about whether a particular piece of data belongs in an Event record or a Findings record. Although an \"event\" is generally perceived as something that happens spontaneously, and has a beginning and end, one should consider the following: • Events of interest in a particular trial may be prespecified, rather than colle cted as free text. • Some events may be so long - lasting that they are perceived as \"conditions\" rather than events, and their beginning and end dates are not of interest. • Some variables or data items one generally expects to see in an Events record may not b e present. For example, a post - marketing study might collect the occurrence of certain adverse events, but no dates. • Properties of an event may be measured or assessed, and these are then treated as findings about events, rather than as events. • Some assess ments of events (e.g., severity, relationship to study treatment) have been built into the SDTM Events model as qualifiers, rather than being treated as findings about events. • Sponsors may choose how they define an event. See Section 6.2.1, Adverse Events , assumption 7 e. The structure of the data being considered, although not definitive, will often help determine whether the data represent as an event or a finding. The following table presents questions that may assist sponsors in deciding where data should be placed in SDTM. Question Interpretation of Answers Is this a measurement, with units, etc.? • A “Yes” answer indicates a finding.

The fact that these data are findings about symptoms does not mean that the data should be represented in FA rather than a QRS domain (QS, FT, or RS). • Data about symptoms may be collected in a format that is usually asso ciated with questionnaires and rating scales (e.g., visual analog scale). This format alone does not mean that the data should be represented in a QRS domain. A record in the Events general observation class is intended to represent the event as a whole. (Note that sponsors may choose how they define the \"event as a whole.\" See Section 6.2.1, Adverse Events , assumption 7 e.) Such a record typically includes what the condition was (captured in -- TERM, the topic v ariable) and when it happened (captured in its start and/or end dates). Other qualifier values (e.g., severity, seriousness) apply to the totality of the event. Data that do not describe the event as a whole should not be stored in the record for that even t or in a -- SUPP record tied to that event. If there are multiple assessments of an event, then each should be stored in a separate FA record. When data related to an event do not fit into one of the existing Event general observation class qualifiers, the first question to consider is whether the data represent information about the event itself , or about something (a finding or intervention) that is associated with the event. • If the data consist of a finding or intervention that is associated with the event, it is likely that it can be stored in a relevant Findings or Intervention general observation class dataset, with the connection to the Event record being captured using RELREC. For example, if a subject had a fever of 102°F that was treated with as pirin, the fever would be stored in an AE record, the temperature could be stored in a Vital Signs record, and the aspirin could be stored in a Concomitant Medication record; RELREC might be used to link those records. • If the data item contains information about the event, then the choices for representing it are a supplemental qualifier or in an FA record. The data should be represented as a supplemental qualifier unless circumstances rule out the use of a supplemental qualifier.

The variable POOLID was developed for nonclinical studies, where assessments may be made fo r groups of animals, and identifiers are needed for those groups (pools). It is included here because POOLID can be used for human clinical trials, if necessary. If POOLID is submitted, the POOLDEF dataset must be submitted. 3. If POOLID is submitted, then in any record, 1 and only 1 of USUBJID and POOLID must be populated. 4. If a study does not include the use of POOLID, then USUBJID must be populated in every record. 5. RSUBJID must be a USUBJID value present in the Demographics (DM) domain. RSUBJID must be popul ated in every record. 6. Values of SREL should be taken from the CDISC Controlled Terminology codelist RELSUB wherever possible. However, if an appropriate term does not exist in the codelist, another term may be used. The SREL term should not be less specifi c than the verbatim term collected. For instance, it would be inappropriate to record a relationship using the term \"RELATIVE, FIRST DEGREE\" when the collected relationship was \"brother\". 7. Every relationship between 2 study subjects is represented in RELSUB as 2 directional relationships: (1) with the first subject's identifier in USUBJID and the second subject's identifier in RSUBJID, and (2) with the second subject's identifier in USUBJID and the first subject's identifier in RSUBJID. The SREL values in th e 2 records will describe the same relationship, but from the viewpoint of each subject (e.g., \"MOTHER, BIOLOGICAL\"; \"CHILD, BIOLOGICAL\") 8. All collected relationships between subjects should be recorded in RELSUB. In some cases, 2 subjects may have more tha n 1 relationship. For instance, a woman might be both maternal aunt and wet nurse to an infant. When there are multiple relationships between 2 subjects, each relationship will be represented by 2 records in RELSUB.

The rationale behind this change was that the lesion counts are properties of the rash in the same way that its longest diameter is a property of the rash, so that OBJ should be the rash, rat her than the name of one of its kinds of component lesions. • In Example 3, symptom occurrence and severity data that was represented in FA in previous versions of the example was represented in MH in this version of the example. o Whether or not there is a record for RA in the MH domain does not affect the modeling of the symptoms of RA. o Average daily duration of early morning stiffness that was represented in FA in previous versions of the example was represented in SUPPMH in this version of the example. • On e of two similar examples about GERD symptoms was removed.

Without collection of occurrence, there would be no records for symptoms that did not occur, and no indication that these terms were pre - specified.
