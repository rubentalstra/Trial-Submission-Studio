SEND covers general toxicology, carcinogenicity, and other nonclinical study types. The primary differences from clinical SDTM include the use of animal-specific identifiers, group-level data collection patterns, and domains specific to nonclinical research.",

      "content": "In SEND, USUBJID uniquely identifies each animal subject. Unlike clinical studies, nonclinical USUBJID is typically derived from STUDYID and an animal identification number specific to the facility. SUBJID contains the animal's identifier as assigned by the testing facility. SETCD identifies the treatment set (dose group) to which the animal was assigned. The SET variable contains the description of that treatment set.",

      "content": "The SPECIES variable identifies the species of the test animal using CDISC controlled terminology. Common values include RAT, MOUSE, DOG, RABBIT, and MONKEY. The STRAIN variable further specifies the strain or substrain, such as Sprague-Dawley for rats or Beagle for dogs. These variables are required in the DM domain for all nonclinical studies.",

      "content": "The Exposure domain records information about the administration of study treatments. EXTRT contains the name of the treatment. EXDOSE records the numeric dose administered. EXDOSU contains the dose units (e.g., mg/kg). EXROUTE specifies the route of administration from controlled terminology (e.g., ORAL, INTRAVENOUS, SUBCUTANEOUS). For nonclinical studies, exposure records are typically created for each dosing event or each constant-dosing interval.",
