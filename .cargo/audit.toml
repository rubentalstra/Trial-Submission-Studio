# These warnings represent maintenance status issues, not active security vulnerabilities.
# They are monitored and will be addressed through upstream updates.

[advisories]
# Ignore specific advisories
# GTK3 bindings warnings - successfully removed by disabling gtk feature in muda
# Remaining warnings are from deep transitive dependencies with no current maintenance alternatives

    # RUSTSEC-2025-0141: bincode 2.0.1 - unmaintained
    # Transitive: polars 0.51.0 -> polars-utils -> bincode
    # Impact: Used internally by polars for serialization, not exposed in public APIs
    # Path forward: Upgrade polars when new version removes bincode dependency

    # Impact: Stable macro crate, used only at compile time
    # Path forward: Upgrade rav1e/image when they update macro dependencies
