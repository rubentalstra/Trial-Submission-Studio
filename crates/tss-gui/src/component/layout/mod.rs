//! Layout components for page structure.
//!
//! This module contains components for structuring page layouts:
//!
//! - **SplitView**: Master-detail split layout (consolidates master_detail variants)
//! - **PageLayout**: Standard page structure with header/content/footer
//!
//! # Planned Migration
//!
//! Components to move here:
//! - `master_detail.rs` -> `split_view.rs`
//! - New `page_layout.rs` for consistent page structure

// Components will be added as they are migrated
