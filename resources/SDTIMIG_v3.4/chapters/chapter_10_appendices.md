Appendix C: Controlled Terminology CDISC Terminology is centrally managed by the CDISC Controlled Terminology Team, supporting the terminology needs of all CDISC foundational standards (SDTM, CDASH, ADaM, SEND) and all disease/therapeutic area standards. New/modified terms have a 3-month development period during which the Controlled Terminology Team evaluates the requests received, incorporating as much as possible for each quarterly release, and a quarterly public-review comment period followed by publication release. Visit the CDISC Controlled Terminology page (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlledterminology) to find the most recently published terminology packages (final or under review), or the NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services CDISC Terminology website (https://www.cancer.gov/research/resources/terminology/cdisc) for access to the full list of CDISC terminology. Note that the SDTM terminology was previously provided separately for questionnaires and other domains. However, as of the 2015-12-18 release of CDISC Controlled Terminology, these were merged into a single publication. Earlier versions of the SDTMIG included several appendices regarding controlled terminology. Starting with SDTMIG 3.2, Appendix C was simplified. Appendix C1 will be considered for expansion in the next version, to contain a complete list of supplemental qualifiers used in the SDTMIG. Appendix C1: Supplemental Qualifiers Name Codes The following table contains an initial set of standard name codes for use in the supplemental qualifiers (SUPP--) special-purpose datasets.

| QNAM | QLABEL | Applicable Domains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AESOSP | Other Medically Important SAE | AE |
| AETRTEM | Treatment Emergent Flag | AE |
| --REAS | Reason | Intervention domains where the reason for an intervention is other than a medical<br>indication. It may be used in select Event domains (e.g., Healthcare Encounters)<br>where the topic is not a medical condition. |

Appendix D: CDISC Variable-naming Fragments The CDISC SDS group has defined a standard list of fragments to use as a guide when naming variables in SUPP-datasets (as QNAM) or assigning --TESTCD values that could conceivably be treated as variables in a horizontal listing derived from a Findings dataset. In some cases, more than 1 fragment is used for a given keyword. This is necessary when a shorter fragment must be used for a --TESTCD or QNAM that incorporates several keywords that must be combined while still meeting the 8-character variable naming limit of SAS transport files. When using fragments, the general rule is to use the fragment(s) that best conveys the meaning of the variable within the 8character limit; thus, the longer fragment should be used when space allows. If the combination of fragments still exceeds 8 characters, a character should be dropped where most appropriate (while avoiding naming conflicts if possible) to fit within the 8-character limit. In other cases the same fragment may be used for more than one meaning, but these would not normally overlap for the same variable.

Appendix E: Revision History This appendix provides an overview only of revisions since the last production version, SDTMIG v3.3; not all revisions are included.
• A Diff file with details of changes to domain specification tables is available as a member benefit on the
CDISC Library Archives page in the Members Only Area of the CDISC website (https://www.cdisc.org/members-only/cdisc-library-archives), and those changes are not repeated here.
• Public review comments and their dispositions will be available upon publication of the SDTMIG.
The following changes have been made throughout:
• Text and examples have been clarified as needed.
• Text was updated to reflect new table names in SDTM v2.0.
• Values were updated to current CDISC Controlled Terminology.
• ISO formats were made more granular.
• New variables from SDTM v2.0 have been added.
• Tables with domain codes and descriptions at the start of a section have been replaced with a sectional table
of contents since each domain section already contains all of the information previously in the tables.
• With few exceptions (e.g., the DM domain), the names of supplemental qualifier variables have been
updated to include 2-character domain abbreviations at the start of the variable name.
• Assumptions which provided domain definitions were removed as these are provided under the
Description/Overview for each domain.
• Where numbered lists occurred in CDISC Notes, these have been converted to text for consistency with the
rest of the document.
• Links were updated as needed.
• Typographical errors were corrected.
A note on the decommissioning of MO The following domain was removed:
• Morphology (MO)
When the Morphology domain was introduced in SDTMIG v3.2, the SDS Team planned to represent morphology and physiology findings in separate domains: morphology findings in the MO domain and physiology findings in separate domains by body systems. Since then, the team found that separating morphology and physiology findings was more difficult than anticipated and provided little added value. This led to the decision to expand the body system-based domains to cover both morphology and physiology findings and to deprecate MO in SDTMIG v3.4. Submissions using that later SDTMIG version would represent morphology results in the appropriate body system-based physiology/morphology domain. For data prepared using a version of the SDTMIG that includes both the MO domain and body system-based physiology/morphology domains, morphology findings may be represented in either the MO domain or in a body-system based physiology/morphology domain. Custom body system-based domains may be used if the appropriate body system-based domain is not included in the SDTMIG version being used.

New Domains for SDTMIG v3.4

In addition to the general changes described above, the following table provides an overview of changes by section.

| Domain | Domain Abbreviation |
| --- | --- |
| Biospecimen Events | BE |
| Biospecimen Findings | BS |
| Cell Phenotyping Findings | CP |
| Genomics Findings | GF |
| Related Specimens | RELSPEC |

| Section<br>Number | Section Name | Change(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section 1. Introduction |  |  |
| 1.3 | Relationship to Prior CDISC Documents | • Rather than referring to all of the sections with significant changes,<br>some of the more significant changes since SDTMIG v3.3 are<br>highlighted in a bulleted list. |
| Section 2. Fundamentals of the SDTM |  |  |
| 2.1 | Observations and Variables | Revised definition for Rule Variables. |
| 2.5 | The SDTM Standard Domain Models | • Domain-specific versioning, introduced in SDTMIG v3.3, was<br>removed. The text in this section describing domain versions was<br>removed. Domain version numbers were also removed for each<br>domain.<br>• Removed sentence that referred to the FDA repository.<br>• Added reference to the Define-XML standard for details on no data<br>availability. |
| 2.6 | Creating a New Domain | • SA was added to bullet 3e to reserve the domain code for CDASH.<br>SQ was also added as it occurs in the SDTMIG-AP. |
| 2.7 | SDTM Variables Not Allowed in the<br>SDTMIG | • Updated based on the Usage Restrictions column of Study Data<br>Tabulation Model 2.0. Review Section 2.7 for the complete list of<br>variables not to be used in SDTM-based data for human clinical trials.<br>Moved --METHOD (Interventions) from the not-evaluated list to the list<br>of variables not to be used. Updated order of list to match order within<br>the model. |
| Section 3. Submitting Data in a Standard Format |  |  |
| 3.2 | Using the CDISC Domain Models in<br>Regulatory Submissions – Dataset<br>Metadata | • Removed the following paragraph as there are now guidelines in the<br>MSG v2.0 and the Define-XML v2.1 standard:<br>"In the event that no records are present in a dataset (e.g., a small PK<br>study where no subjects took concomitant medications), the empty<br>dataset should not be submitted and should not be described in the<br>Define-XML document. The annotated CRF will show the data that<br>would have been submitted had data been received; it need not be re-<br>annotated to indicate that no records exist." |
| 3.2.1 | Dataset-level Metadata | • Changes to SDTMIG Content Control appear in this table. New<br>domains were added and MO was removed.<br>• Keys were updated in a couple of cases, as noted in those domains. |
| 3.2.1.2 | CDISC Submission Value-level Metadata | • The phrase "the SDTMIG V3.x" was removed from the first sentence,<br>as this terminology was somewhat confusing and is being phased out. |
| Section 4. Assumptions for Domain Models |  |  |
| 4.1 | General Domain Assumptions | • QRS Examples for splitting questionnaires were updated.<br>• Origin Metadata traceability was clarified. |
| 4.2 | General Variable Assumptions | • Added, "CDISC does not recommend any specific format for the<br>values of USUBJID, only that the values need to be unique for all<br>subjects in the submission, and across multiple submissions for the<br>same compound. Many sponsors concatenate values for the Study,<br>Site and Subject into USUBJID, but this is not a requirement. It is |


## Page 454

| Section<br>Number | Section Name | Change(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | acceptable to use any format for USUBJID, as long as the values are<br>unique across all subjects."<br>• 4.2.6 numbering reworked to be consistent with the format in this<br>document and others.<br>• New subsection, Section 4.2.7.4, "Specify" Values for --OBJ, was<br>added.<br>• Added information about ASCII characters to Section 4.2.9. |
| 4.4 | Actual and Relative Time Assumptions | • Updated values for unknown from U to UNKNOWN to reflect changes<br>in controlled terminology.<br>• Clarified that if the reference time point corresponds to or is prior to<br>the date of collection or assessment that it can be unknown by adding<br>"can be".<br>• Text was clarified to note that --STDTC is not used in Findings class<br>domains<br>• the use of --DRVFL was clarified |
| 4.5 | Original and Standardized Results | • Clarified description of when to use the derived flag (–DRVFL).<br>• Two QRS exceptions were added to Section 4.5.1.2 noting that<br>regulatory agencies may require a record for all items on the CRF and<br>that --REASND will be populated for QRS logically skipped items.<br>• Example 3 in Section 4.5.3.2, the value of IDVARVAL was corrected<br>in supppr.xpt.<br>• Promoted the concept --CLSIG to an SDTM variable.<br>• Clarified the use of --REASPF in Findings domains, --REAS in<br>Interventions/Events, and --REASOC for pre-specified<br>Events/Interventions.<br>• Changed the description of --REASOC to reflect its promotion to a<br>standard variable.<br>• Added text describing representation of pre-specified groups of<br>interventions or events in --TRT or --TERM, respectively. |
| 4.1 | General Domain Assumptions | • QRS Examples for splitting questionnaires were updated.<br>• Origin Metadata traceability was clarified. |
| Section 5. Models for Special-purpose Domains |  |  |
| 5 | Models for Special-purpose Domains | • All SDTMIG v3.4 metadata specifications (under Controlled Terms,<br>Codelist or Format column) have been updated to reflect ISO 8601<br>granularity (e.g., "ISO 8601 datetime or interval" or "ISO 8601<br>duration"), where applicable. This also aligns to the updates made in<br>SDTM v2.0. |
| 5.1 | Comments (CO) | • Assumption 2 was added to explain the difference between the<br>structure of the Comments domain in the SDTM and the SDTMIG.<br>• VISIT, VISITNUM, and VISITDY have been removed from the list of<br>generally not used variables in CO Assumptions #5.<br>• Clarity was added to Assumption 1 regarding adverse events and<br>clinical events |
| 5.2 | Demographics (DM) | • Revised DM.COUNTRY CDISC Notes to include "Generally<br>represented using ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3. However, please be advised<br>that regulatory agency specific requirements may differ (e.g., U.S.<br>FDA), in which, those need to be followed." We removed the ISO<br>3166-1 Alpha-3 format from the Controlled Terms column as we<br>became aware of the varied national requirements for this<br>terminology.<br>• Assumption 6 was updated to include cases where race self-<br>identification can also correspond to "Unknown" (e.g., a refugee, was<br>adopted, or cases where this information was not available).<br>• Updated assumption 6a to reference the Racec-Ethnicc Codetable<br>available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-<br>terminology.<br>• Extensive updates occurred with DM examples. Previous DM<br>Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 were removed; Current Examples 4 thru |


## Page 455

| Section<br>Number | Section Name | Change(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 7 were added with new examples illustrating better the continuity<br>between CDASH and SDTM.<br>• Updated DM Example references in the assumptions and throughout<br>the SDTMIG. |
| 5.3 | Subject Elements (SE) | • Added SESTDY and SEENDY. |
| 5.4 | Subject Disease Milestones (SM) | • Updated CDISC notes for USUBJID for consistency. |
| 5.5 | Subject Visits (SV) | • This domain had been considered for moving to Events, but the<br>decision after public review was to keep it as a Subject Visits domain<br>at this time.<br>• Now contains visits that did not occur as well as those that did occur<br>• Information was added about contacts with subjects which may not<br>have been designated as "visits" in the protocol<br>• New variables were added: SVPRESP, SVOCCUR, SVREASOC,<br>SVCNTMOD, SVEPCHGI |
| Section 6. Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes |  |  |
| 6.1 | Models for Interventions Domains | • The roles of --DOSFRQ and --DOSRGM were changed where used in<br>the Interventions Domains to Record Qualifier for consistency with the<br>change for the role of --DOSFRQ and --DOSRGM in the SDTM. |
| 6.1.2 | Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) | • Example 5 is new. |
| 6.1.3 | Exposure Domains | • EX assumptions were updated to note that since EX includes only<br>treatments received, --MOOD would generally not be used in EX.<br>• ECREASOC was added, as this was promoted from a supplemental<br>qualifier to a standard variable. An assumption was added to EC to<br>describe the use of ECREASOC and some examples were updated to<br>reflect this. |
| 6.1.5 | Procedures (PR) | • PRSEQ's CDISC Notes were updated to reflect that Sequence<br>Number is given to ensure uniqueness of subject records within a<br>domain and that it may be any valid number.<br>• Added CT reference to the procedure codelist (PROCEDUR) for the<br>PRDECOD variable.<br>• More explanations were provided in examples to explain why values<br>in PRTRT are in mixed case. |
| 6.2 | Models for Events Domains | • The BE Domain specification and examples were copied from the<br>SDTMIG-PGx, originally published 2015-05-26, to be deprecated with<br>the publication of SDTMIG v3.4. |
| 6.2.1 | Adverse Events (AE) | • New AE variables for Medical Devices were added: SPDEVID,<br>AEACNDEV, AEUNANT, AERLPRC, AERLPRT, AERLDEV,<br>AESINTV.<br>• New Examples 5 and 6 were added to show examples of the new AE<br>variables.<br>• We have deleted AE Assumption 2e as this was superseded by the<br>addition of MedDRA coding variables in Amendment 1 to SDTMIG<br>v3.1.2 and SDTM v1.2.<br>• Assumption 6, Actions taken, was added. |
| 6.2.2 | Biospecimen Events (BE) | • This specification, assumptions, and examples were copied from the<br>SDTMIG-PGx, published 2015-05-26, the BETERM and BEDECOD<br>have been updated. PF has also been updated to GF. SDTMIG-PGx,<br>originally published 2015-05-26, is to be deprecated with the<br>publication of SDTMIG v3.4. |
| 6.2.3 | Clinical Events | • Added the permissible variable CETOXGR.<br>• Added fracture events example. A previous version of the example<br>was represented in the FA domain.<br>• The Examples 1 and 2 were revised for better clarity. |
| 6.2.4 | Disposition (DS) | • DSDY's Core value was updated to Perm (from Exp) to be consistent<br>with DSDTC's Core which is Perm. |


## Page 456

| Section<br>Number | Section Name | Change(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | • DSSTDY's Core value updated to Exp (from Perm) to be consistent<br>with DSSTDTC's Core which is Exp.<br>• Added reference to DS Codetable.<br>• Updated Example 9 |
| 6.2.5 | Healthcare Encounters (HO) | • Example 5 and Assumption 5 were corrected to refer to Events<br>qualifiers rather than Findings qualifiers. |
| 6.2.6 | Medical History (MH) | • Example 5 was added to illustrate the presence of prespecified<br>events. |
| 6.2.7 | Protocol Deviations (DV) | • Revised label for DVENDY to 'Study Day of End of Deviation Event'<br>(from Study Day of End of Observation) to be consistent with<br>DVSTDY's label.<br>• Assumption 3 was corrected to refer to Events qualifiers rather than<br>Findings qualifiers. |
| 6.3 | Models for Findings Domains | • The BS Domain specification and examples were copied from the<br>SDTMIG-PGx, originally published 2015-05-26, to be deprecated with<br>the publication of SDTMIG v3.4.<br>• Assumptions and examples have been updated where used in the<br>Findings Domains to reflect that --CLSIG has been promoted to a<br>standard variable. Notes were added to emphasize that the variable is<br>about collected observations. |
| 6.3.1 | Product Accountability (DA) | • Revised domain name (and definition) to "Product Accountability"<br>from "Drug Accountability".<br>• Added the permissible variables DALNKID and DALNKGRP.<br>• Revised assumptions to describe broadened product accountability<br>scope (e.g., drugs, nutrition).<br>• Excluded devices from representation in this domain. |
| 6.3.2 | Death Details (DD) | • Added assumption 4 referencing the domain codetable. |
| 6.3.3 | ECG Test Results (EG) | • Added EGCLSIG as a permissible variable.<br>• Updated EGBEATNO role from "Variable Qualifier" to "Identifier" to<br>align with SDTM v2.0.<br>• Added Assumption 2.a referencing the ECG codetable. |
| 6.3.5 | Specimen-based Findings Domains | • Added Section 6.3.5 to group domains (e.g., IS, LB, MB/MS, MI,<br>PC/PP) that represent laboratory measurements, tests, or<br>examinations performed on collected biological specimens (e.g.,<br>blood, urine, tumor tissue). |
| 6.3.5.1 | Generic Specimen-based Lab Findings<br>Domain Specification | • Added Section 6.3.5.1 generic metadata specification to describe<br>commonly used variables in specimen-based laboratory domains. |
| 6.3.5.2 | Biospecimen Findings (BS) | • This is newly copied from SDTMIG-PGx, with only minor corrections<br>(e.g., typos). SDTMIG-PGx, originally published 2015-05-26, is to be<br>deprecated with the publication of SDTMIG v3.4.<br>• Row 5 has been removed as well as the reference to the Maycox<br>paper because these are out of date and may be incorrect. It would<br>cause confusion to leave it in. |
| 6.3.5.3 | Cell Phenotype Findings (CP) | • This is a new domain. |
| 6.3.5.4 | Genomics Findings (GF) | • This is a new domain and replaces the PF domain from the<br>provisional SDTMIG-PGx, originally published 2015-05-26, to be<br>deprecated with the publication of SDTMIG v3.4. |
| 6.3.5.5 | Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments<br>(IS) | • The domain definition has been updated. Note, however, that the<br>definition will be finalized through the Controlled Terminology process,<br>and the final definition may change from that shown here.<br>• Added 6 new variables: ISBDAGNT, ISMSCBCE, ISTSTOPO,<br>ISTSTCND, ISCNDAGT, and NHOID.<br>• Added permissible variables that were previously not included in the<br>IS domain specification.<br>• Replaced assumptions from SDTMIG v3.3.<br>• Examples 1 and 2 replaced with new content; Examples 3-11 added. |

| 6.3.5.6 | Laboratory Test Results (LB) | • Revised LBTESTCD variable label to Lab Test or Examination Short<br>Name.<br>• Revised Core value for LBSTREFC to Perm (from Exp).<br>• Added new variables: LBTSTCND, LBBDAGNT,<br>LBTSTOPO, LBRSLSCL, LBRESTYP, LBCOLSRT,<br>LBLLOD, LBTMTHSN, LBCLSIG, LBPTFL, and LBPDUR.<br>• Added permissible variables that were previously not included in the<br>LB domain specification: LBSPCUFL, LBANMETH, LBORREF,<br>LBSTREFN.<br>• Added hyperlink to Controlled Terminology codelists .<br>• LBORREF, LBSTREFC, and LBSTREFN were removed because<br>there is no clear use case.<br>• Updated several assumptions; added Assumption 8.<br>• Revised Examples 1-3 per changes to variables; added Examples 4<br>and 5 to demonstrate the use of some of the new variables. |
| 6.4 | Findings About Events or Interventions | • Added "Events or Interventions" to the FA domain name.<br>• Added assumption 4a, referencing the CV codetable. |
| 6.4.1 | When to Use Findings About Events or<br>Interventions | • Additional explanation and examples were added for each criterion.<br>• The new criterion added in version the underwent the first public<br>review was removed. The new "Points to Consider" section was<br>added.<br>• The third and fourth bullets were dropped as a criterion for<br>representing data in FA. The reasons for dropping these criteria, and<br>guidance on how these situations should be approached were added. |
| 6.4.3 | Variables Unique to Findings About | • Added a sentence to state that an FA record will not necessarily have<br>a parent record, to make it clear that the information about FAOBJ<br>matching --TETM, --TRT, or --DECOD is not meant to imply that an<br>FA record must have a parent record. |
| 6.4.4 | Findings About Events or Interventions<br>(FA) | • The core value for FADTC was changed from "Perm" to "Exp" for<br>consistency with other Findings domains.<br>• Updated the FATEST and FATESTCD CDISC Notes to refer to the<br>FATEST and FATESTCD general codelists, which are expected to be<br>available at time of publication in Nov, 2021.<br>• Added assumption 4.a, referencing the CV Code table.<br>• The example about fracture events (previous Example 4) was<br>removed. A revised version of the example was added to Section<br>6.2.3, Clinical Events.<br>• All Examples and associated CRFs were updated for clarity.<br>• In Example 2, the modeling of numbers of lesions associated with the<br>rash was changed to a TEST/TESTCD for a categorical measure of<br>the number of lesions (e.g. "MACRNG"/"Macule Range" with OBJ =<br>"Injection Site Rash"). The rationale behind this change was that the<br>lesion counts are properties of the rash in the same way that its<br>longest diameter is a property of the rash, so that OBJ should be the<br>rash, rather than the name of one of its kinds of component lesions.<br>• In Example 3, symptom occurrence and severity data that was<br>represented in FA in previous versions of the example was<br>represented in MH in this version of the example.<br>o Whether or not there is a record for RA in the MH domain does not<br>affect the modeling of the symptoms of RA.<br>o Average daily duration of early morning stiffness that was<br>represented in FA in previous versions of the example was<br>represented in SUPPMH in this version of the example.<br>• One of two similar examples about GERD symptoms was removed.<br>The difference between the previous Example 6 and Example 7 was<br>that Example 6 did not include collection of occurrence of symptoms.<br>Without collection of occurrence, there would be no records for<br>symptoms that did not occur, and no indication that these terms were<br>pre-specified. The form that collects occurrence is preferable as it is<br>more explicit. Added mock eCRF modules. Other variables were |

|  |  | added including AESPID, FACOLSRT, and FAEVINTX. RELREC.xpt<br>was also added to represent the AE and FA dataset-to-dataset<br>relationship. |
| 6.4.5 | Skin Response (SR) | • Updated CDISC Notes for USUBJID to be consistent with other<br>domains.<br>• In Example 1, revised representation of quadrants 1, 2, 3, 4 of the<br>back from a supplemental qualifier to FOCID. QUADRANT1-<br>QUADRANT4 values were changed to SITE1-SITE8 so each site has<br>a unique FOCID.<br>• Example 3 was updated per CDISC CT. |
| Section 7. Trial Design Model Datasets |  |  |
| 7.2 | Experimental Design (TA and TE) | • Text about executable code in Section 7.2.1.1 was replaced to note<br>that it is expected that a mechanism to provide machine-readable rules<br>will become available in the future.<br>• Aligned wording for Rule variables on CDISC Notes between TA<br>and TE.<br>• The name of the dataset in the Section 7.2.2.1 example was<br>changed from "ta.xpt" to "special.xpt" since, as explained in the text, this<br>is a dataset that would not be submitted and is not based on the TA<br>domain. |
| 7.3.1 | Trial Visits (TV) | • Made VISIT required and revised VISIT CDISC Notes. |
| 7.3.2 | Trial Disease Assessments (TD) | • Assumption 4 was inserted to clarify that the start of a schedule is<br>the start of the interval preceding the first assessment in the schedule.<br>• Examples 1 and 3 diagrams were updated to clarify the points in<br>time at which assessments were planned and values of TDSTOFF were<br>corrected. |
| 7.3.3 | Trial Disease Milestones (TM) | • The role of TMDEF was changed from "Rule" to "Variable<br>Qualifier". This is for consistency with a clarification of the description of<br>the Rule role in SDTM and the change of role in the SDTM from "Rule" to<br>"Variable Qualifier" with Variable Qualified "MIDSTYPE". |
| 7.4 | Trial Eligibility and Summary (TI and TS) | • The order had been flipped here for TI and TS; this has now been<br>corrected and the section numbers updated. |
| 7.4.1 | Trial Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (TI) | • The section describing the proposed removal of TIRL was added. |
| 7.4.2 | Trial Summary (TS) | • Changed the CDISC Notes for TSSEQ to reflect that the sequence<br>number is to ensure uniqueness within a parameter.<br>• Revisions to most TS assumptions to remove references to<br>Appendix C1, Trial Summary Codes, as this appendix was removed.<br>Assumptions were replaced with ones that note recipients may specify<br>requirements and terminology. A reference was added for the TS<br>Codetable on the CDISC website.<br>• Revised TS Assumption 17 to clarify the value expectations for<br>TSPARMCD = "INDIC" for the two example use cases that are<br>described.<br>• Additional assumptions revised for clarity; information added about<br>exploratory outcome measures.<br>• Examples 1-3 were revised per changes in assumptions.<br>• New content was added to Example 4 to show the use of TSGRPID<br>for study parts and treatments. |
| Section 8. Representing Relationships and Data |  |  |
| 8 | Representing Relationships and Data | • Section 8.8, Related Specimens, was added due to BE, BS, and<br>RELSPEC being copied in from the SDTMIG-PGx, originally<br>published 2015-05-26, to be deprecated with the publication of<br>SDTMIG v3.4. |
| 8.2.2 | RELREC Dataset Examples | • The introductory text was updated to more clearly describe how<br>relationships are represented in RELREC. |
