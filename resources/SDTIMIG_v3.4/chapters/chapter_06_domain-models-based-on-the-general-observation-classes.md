6 Domain Models Based on the General Observation Classes
6.1 Models for Interventions Domains
Most subject-level observations collected during the study should be represented according to one of the 3 SDTM general observation classes. The domains in the Interventions class include:
6.1.1 Procedure Agents (AG)
AG – Description/Overview An interventions domain that contains the agents administered to the subject as part of a procedure or assessment, as opposed to drugs, medications and therapies administered with therapeutic intent. AG – Specification ag.xpt, Procedure Agents — Interventions. One record per recorded intervention occurrence per subject, Tabulation.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. AG – Assumptions
1. Purpose of the domain: Some tests involve administration of substances, and it has been unclear in which domain these should be represented.
a. The Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) domain seemed particularly inappropriate when the substance was one that would never be given as a medication. Even substances that are medications are not being used as such when they are given as part of a testing procedure. b. The Exposure (EX) domain also seemed inappropriate; although the testing procedure might be part of the study plan, these data would not be used or analyzed in the same way as data about study treatments. The AG domain was created to fill this gap. c. The AG domain has advantages over the Procedures (PR) domain for this purpose. It allows recording of multiple substance administrations for a single testing procedure. It also separates data about substance administrations from data about procedures that do not involve substance administration. d. Information about the conduct of the procedure with which the procedure agent administration was associated, if collected, should be represented in the PR domain.
2. Examples and structure
a. Examples of agents administered as part of a procedure include a short-acting bronchodilator administered as part of a reversibility assessment and contrast agents or radio-labeled substances used in imaging studies.

|  |  |  |  |  | or "CONTINUING" was collected, this information may be translated into AGSTRF. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not all values of the codelist are allowable for this variable. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |
| AGENRF | End Relative to<br>Reference Period | Char | (STENRF) | Timing | Describes the end of the agent relative to the sponsor-defined reference period. The sponsor-defined | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | reference period is a continuous period of time defined by a discrete starting point and a discrete ending |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | point (represented by RFSTDTC and RFENDTC in Demographics). If information such as "PRIOR", |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | "ONGOING", or "CONTINUING" was collected, this information may be translated into AGENRF. |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |
| AGSTRTPT | Start Relative to<br>Reference Time<br>Point | Char | (STENRF) | Timing | Identifies the start of the agent as being before or after the sponsor-defined reference time point defined by | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | variable AGSTTPT. |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | AGENTPT. Identifies the end of the agent as being before or after the sponsor-defined reference time point |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | defined by variable AGENTPT. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not all values of the codelist are allowable for this variable. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |

b. The structure of the AG domain is 1 record per agent intervention episode, or prespecified agent assessment per subject. It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an intervention episode. This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for review and analysis.
3. AG description and coding
a. AGTRT captures the name of the agent and it is the topic variable. It is a required variable and must have a value. AGTRT should include only the agent name, and should not include dosage, formulation, or other qualifying information. For example, "ALBUTEROL 2 PUFF" is not a valid value for AGTRT. This example should be expressed as AGTRT = "ALBUTEROL", AGDOSE = "2", AGDOSU = "PUFF", and AGDOSFRM = "AEROSOL". b. AGMODIFY should be included if the sponsor's procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. c. AGDECOD is the standardized agent term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary. It is possible that the reported term (AGTRT) or the modified term (AGMODIFY) can be coded using a standard dictionary. In such cases, sponsors are expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document.
4. Prespecified terms; presence or absence of procedure agents
a. AGPRESP is used to indicate whether an agent was prespecified. b. AGOCCUR is used to indicate whether a prespecified agent was used. A value of "Y" indicates that the agent was used and "N" indicates that it was not. c. If an agent was not prespecified, the value of AGOCCUR should be null. AGPRESP and AGOCCUR are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all agents were collected as free text. Values of AGOCCUR may also be null for prespecified agents if no Y/N response was collected; in this case, AGSTAT = "NOT DONE", and AGREASND could be used to describe the reason the answer was missing.
5. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or interventions general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the AG domain.
a. However, --INDC, although allowed, would not generally be used because substance administrations represented in AG are given as part of a testing procedure rather than with therapeutic intent. b. The variables --DOSTOT and --DOSRGM, although allowed, would generally not be used because procedure agents are likely to be recorded at the level of single administrations. AG – Examples Example 1 This example captures data about the allergen administered to the subject as part of a bronchial allergen challenge (BAC) test. Prior to the BAC, the subject had a skin-prick allergen test to help identify the allergen to be used for the BAC test. The skin-prick test identified grass as the allergen to be used in the BAC test. Data from the allergen skin test are not shown, but the CRF for the BAC includes collection of the allergen chosen for use in the BAC. A predetermined set of ascending doses of the chosen allergen was used in the screening BAC test. The results of the screening BAC are not shown, but would be represented in the Respiratory System Findings (RE) domain. Row 1: The first dose given in the BAC was saline. Rows 2-4: Three successively higher doses of grass allergen were given.

Example 2 In this example, first there was a check that the subject had not taken a short-acting bronchodilator in the previous 4 hours (Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) domain). Then the procedure agent (AG domain) was given as part of a reversibility assessment. Spirometry measurements (RE domain) were obtained before and after agent administration. An identifier was assigned to the reversibility test and this identifier was used to be link data across the multiple SDTM domains in which the data are represented. The question as to whether a short-acting bronchodilator was administered in the 4 hours prior to the reversibility assessment is represented in the CM domain because this prior administration would have been for therapeutic effect, not as part of the procedure. The question asked was about the administration of any short-acting bronchodilator, rather than a specific medication, so both CMTRT and CMCAT are populated with "SHORT-ACTING BRONCHODILATOR", which describes a group of medications. The CMSPID value RV1 was used to indicate that this question was associated with the reversibility test. cm.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID CMSEQ CMSPID CMTRT CMCAT CMPRESP CMOCCUR CMEVLINT

The administration of albuterol as part of the reversibility procedure is represented in the AG domain. The AGSPID value RV1 was used to indicate that this administration was associated with the reversibility test. ag.xpt

The sponsor populated REGRPID with RV1 to indicate that these pulmonary function tests were associated with the reversibility test. The spirometer used in the testing is identified in SPDEVID. See the SDTMIG-MD (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/medical-devices-sdtmig/) for information about representing device-related information. Row 1: Shows the results for the pre-bronchodilator FEV1 test performed as part of a reversibility assessment. The timing reference variables RETPT, RETPTNUM, REELTM, RETPTREF, and RERFTDTC show that this test was performed 5 minutes before the bronchodilator challenge. Row 2: Shows the results for FEV1 test performed 20 minutes after the bronchodilator challenge. Row 3: Because the percentage reversibility was collected on the CRF, it is included in the SDTM dataset.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. CM – Assumptions
1. The structure of the CM domain is 1 record per medication intervention episode, constant-dosing interval, or prespecified medication assessment per
subject. It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an intervention episode. This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for review and analysis. The submission dataset structure may differ from the structure used for collection. One common approach is to submit a new record when there is a change in the dosing regimen. Another approach is to collapse all records for a medication to a summary level with either a dose range or the highest dose level. Other approaches may also be reasonable as long as they meet the sponsor's evaluation requirements.
2. CM description and coding
a. CMTRT is the topic variable and captures the name of the concomitant medication/therapy or the prespecified term used to collect information about the occurrence of any of a group of medications and/or therapies. It is a required variable and must have a value. CMTRT only includes the medication/therapy name and does not include dosage, formulation, or other qualifying information. For example, “ASPIRIN 100MG TABLET” is not a valid value for CMTRT. This example should be expressed as CMTRT= “ASPIRIN”, CMDOSE= “100”, CMDOSU= “MG”, and CMDOSFRM= “TABLET”. When referring to a prespecified group of medications/therapies, CMTRT contains the description of the group used to solicit the occurrence response. b. CMMODIFY should be included if the sponsor’s procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. c. CMDECOD is the standardized medication/therapy term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary. It is expected that the reported term (CMTRT) or the modified term (CMMODIFY) will be coded using a standard dictionary. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document. d. When CMDECOD values from the WHODrug Dictionary are longer than 200 characters, split the values at semicolons rather than spaces when implementing guidance in Section 4.5.3.2, Text Strings Greater than 200 Characters.
3. Prespecified terms; presence or absence of concomitant medications
a. Information on concomitant medications is generally collected in 2 different ways, either by recording free text or using a prespecified list of terms. Because the solicitation of information on specific concomitant medications may affect the frequency at which they are reported, the fact that a specific medication was solicited may be of interest to reviewers. CMPRESP and CMOCCUR are used together to indicate whether the intervention in CMTRT was prespecified and whether it occurred, respectively.

| CMSTRTPT | Start Relative to<br>Reference Time<br>Point | Char | (STENRF) | Timing | Identifies the start of the medication as being before or after the sponsor-defined reference time point | Perm |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  | defined by variable CMSTTPT. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not all values of the codelist are allowable for this variable. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |
| CMSTTPT | Start Reference<br>Time Point | Char |  | Timing | Description or date/time in ISO 8601 character format of the sponsor-defined reference point referred to by | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CMSTRTPT. Examples: "2003-12-15", "VISIT 1". |  |
| CMENRTPT | End Relative to<br>Reference Time<br>Point | Char | (STENRF) | Timing | Identifies the end of the medication as being before or after the sponsor-defined reference time point | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | defined by variable CMENTPT. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not all values of the codelist are allowable for this variable. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |
| CMENTPT | End Reference<br>Time Point | Char |  | Timing | Description or date/time in ISO 8601 character format of the sponsor-defined reference point referred to by | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CMENRTPT. Examples: "2003-12-25", "VISIT 2". |  |

b. CMOCCUR is used to indicate whether a prespecified medication was used. A value of "Y" indicates that the medication was used and "N" indicates that it was not. c. If a medication was not prespecified, the value of CMOCCUR should be null. CMPRESP and CMOCCUR are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all medications were collected as free text. Values of CMOCCUR may also be null for prespecified medications if no Y/N response was collected; in such cases, CMSTAT = "NOT DONE", and CMREASND could be used to describe the reason the answer was missing.
4. Variables for timing relative to a time point
a. CMSTRTPT, CMSTTPT, CMENRTPT, and CMENTPT may be populated as necessary to indicate when a medication was used relative to specified time points. For example, assume a subject uses birth control medication. The subject has used the same medication for many years and continues to do so. The date the subject began using the medication (or at least a partial date) would be stored in CMSTDTC. CMENDTC is null because the end date is unknown/has not yet happened. This fact can be recorded by setting CMENTPT = "2007-04-30" (the date the assessment was made) and CMENRTPT = "ONGOING".
5. Although any identifier variables, timing variables, or interventions general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the CM domain, the following
qualifiers would generally not be used: --MOOD, --LOT. CM – Examples Example 1 Sponsors collect the timing of concomitant medication use with varying specificity, depending on the pattern of use; the type, purpose, and importance of the medication; and the needs of the study. It is often unnecessary to record every unique instance of medication use, since the same information can be conveyed with start and end dates and frequency of use. If appropriate, medications taken as needed (intermittently or sporadically over a time period) may be reported with a start and end date and a frequency of “PRN”. The example below shows 3 subjects who took the same medication on the same day. Rows 1-6: For subject ABC-0001, each instance of aspirin use was recorded separately, and the frequency in each record is (CMDOSFRQ) is "ONCE". Rows 7-9: For subject ABC-0002, frequency was once a day ("QD") in the first and third records (where CMSEQ is "1" and "3"), but twice a day in the second record (CMSEQ = "2"). Row 10: Records for subject ABC-0003 are collapsed into a single entry that spans the relevant time period, with a frequency of "PRN". This is shown as an example only, not as a recommendation. This approach assumes that knowing exactly when aspirin was used is not important for evaluating safety and efficacy in this study. cm.xpt

Example 3 Sponsors often are interested in whether subjects are exposed to specific concomitant medications, and collect this information using a checklist. This example is for a study that had a particular interest in the antidepressant medications that subjects used. For the study’s purposes, absence is just as important as presence of a medication. This can be clearly shown using CMOCCUR. In this example, CMPRESP shows that the subjects were specifically asked if they use any of 3 antidepressants (Zoloft, Prozac, and Paxil). The value of CMOCCUR indicates the response to the prespecified medication question. CMSTAT indicates whether the response was missing for a prespecified medication, and CMREASND shows the reason for missing response. The medication details (e.g., dose, frequency) were not of interest in this study. Row 1: Medication use was solicited and the medication was taken. Row 2: Medication use was solicited and the medication was not taken. Row 3: Medication use was solicited, but data were not collected. The reason for the lack of a response was collected and is represented in CMREASND. cm.xpt

Example 4 In this hepatitis C study, collection of data on prior treatments included reason for discontinuation. Because hepatitis C is usually treated with a combinations of medications, CMGRPID was used to group records into regimens. Rows 1-3: This subject's treatment consisted of the 3 medications grouped by means of CMGRPID = "1". The subject completed the scheduled treatment. Rows 4-6: Another subject received the same set of 3 medications. The medications for this subject are also grouped using CMGRPID = "1". Note, however, that the fact that the same CMGRPID value has been used for the same set of medications for subjects "ABC123-765" and "ABC123-899" is coincidence; CMGRPID groups records only within a subject. This subject stopped the regimen due to side effects. cm.xpt

Example 5 In this rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study, the sponsor collected medications using the category "Prior RA Medications", then collected information on whether the subject had received certain medication classes, represented as subcategories. If a subject did receive medications in a subcategory, information about those medications was collected. This example shows data for 2 subjects who received prior RA medications. It includes data only about their prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); information about other kinds of prior RA medications is not included. Row 1: Shows that subject 101 received prior RA medications. The values of CMTRT and CMCAT are the same, indicating that this record represents the response to a question about a category of medications, rather than an individual medication. Row 2: Shows that subject 101 did not receive prior DMARDs. The values in CMTRT and CMSCAT are the same, indicating that this record represents the response to a question about a group of medications, rather than an individual medication. Row 3: Shows that subject 102 received prior RA medications. Row 4: Shows that subject 102 received prior DMARDs. Rows 5-6: Show 2 prior DMARDS received by subject 102, one ending before the date of data collection, and the other ongoing at that time.

6.1.3 Exposure Domains
Clinical trial study designs can range from open label (where subjects and investigators know which product each subject is receiving) to blinded (where the subject, investigator, or anyone assessing the outcome is unaware of the treatment assignment(s) to reduce potential for bias). To support standardization of various collection methods and details, as well as process differences between open-label and blinded studies, 2 SDTM domains based on the Interventions General Observation Class are available to represent details of subject exposure to protocol-specified study treatment(s): Exposure (EX) and Exposure as Collected (EC).

1. EX structure and use
a. Examples of treatments represented in the EX domain include but are not limited to placebo, active comparators, and investigational products. Treatments that are not protocol-specified should be represented in the Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) or another Interventions domain as appropriate. b. The EX domain is recognized in most cases as a derived dataset where EXDOSU reflects the protocol-specified unit per study treatment. Collected data points (e.g., number of tablets, total volume infused) along with additional inputs (e.g., randomization file, concentration, dosage strength, product accountability) are used to derive records in the EX domain.

c. The EX domain is required for all studies that include protocol-specified study treatment. Exposure records may be directly or indirectly determined; metadata should describe how the records were derived. Common methods for determining exposure (from most direct to least direct) include the following: i. Derived from actual observation of the administration of drug by the investigator ii. Derived from automated dispensing device that records administrations iii. Derived from subject recall iv. Derived from product accountability data v. Derived from the protocol. When a study is still masked and protocol-specified study treatment doses cannot yet be reflected in the protocolspecified unit due to blinding requirements, then the EX domain is not expected to be populated. d. The EX domain should contain 1 record per constant-dosing interval per subject. Sponsors define the constant-dosing interval, which may include any period of time that can be described in terms of a known treatment given at a consistent dose, frequency, infusion rate, and so on. For example, for a study with once-a-week administration of a standard dose for 6 weeks, exposure may be represented as: i. a single record per subject, spanning the entire 6-week treatment phase, if information about each dose is not collected; or ii. up to 6 records (1 for each weekly administration), if the sponsor monitors each treatment administration.
2. Exposure treatment description
a. EXTRT captures the name of the protocol-specified study treatment and is the topic variable. It is a required variable and must have a value. EXTRT must include only the treatment name and must not include dosage, formulation, or other qualifying information. For example, "ASPIRIN 100MG TABLET" is not a valid value for EXTRT. This example should be expressed as EXTRT = "ASPIRIN", EXDOSE = "100", EXDOSU = "mg", and EXDOSFRM = "TABLET". b. Doses of placebo should be represented by EXTRT = "PLACEBO" and EXDOSE = "0" (indicating 0 mg of active ingredient was taken or administered).
3. Categorization and grouping
a. EXCAT and EXSCAT may be used when appropriate to categorize treatments into categories and subcategories. For example, if a study contains several active comparator medications, EXCAT may be set to "ACTIVE COMPARATOR". Such categorization may not be useful in all studies, so these variables are permissible.
4. Timing variables
a. The timing of exposure to study treatment is captured by the start/end date and start/end time of each constant-dosing interval. If the subject is only exposed to study medication within a clinical encounter (e.g., if an injection is administered at the clinic), VISITNUM may be added to the domain as an additional timing variable. VISITDY and VISIT would then also be permissible qualifiers. However, if the beginning and end of a constantdosing interval is not confined within the time limits of a clinical encounter (e.g., if a subject takes pills at home), then it is not appropriate to include VISITNUM in the EX domain. This is because EX is designed to capture the timing of exposure to treatment, not the timing of dispensing treatment. Further, VISITNUM should not be used to indicate that treatment began at a particular visit and continued for a period of time. The SDTM does not have any provision for recording "start visit" and "end visit" of exposure.


## Page 107

b. For administrations considered given at a point in time (e.g., oral tablet, pre-filled syringe injection), where only an administration date/time is collected, EXSTDTC should be copied to EXENDTC as the standard representation.
5. Collected exposure data points are to be represented in the Exposure as Collected (EC) domain. When the relationship between EC and EX records can
be described in RELREC, then it should be defined. EX derivations must be described in the Define-XML document.Additional interventions qualifiers
6. Additional interventions qualifiers
a. EX contains medications received; the inclusion of administrations not taken, not given, or missed is under evaluation. Because EX includes only treatments received, --MOOD would generally not be used in EX. b. --DOSTOT is under evaluation for potential deprecation and replacement with a mechanism to describe total dose over any interval of time (e.g., day, week, month). Sponsors considering use of EXDOSTOT may want to consider using other dose-amount variables (EXDOSE or EXDOSTXT) in combination with frequency (EXDOSFRQ) and timing variables to represent the data. c. When the EC domain is implemented in conjunction with the EX domain, EXVAMT and EXVAMTU would not be used in EX; collected values instead would be represented in ECDOSE and ECDOSU (and ECVAMT and ECVAMTU as needed). d. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the EX domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: –PRESP, --OCCUR, --STAT, and --REASND.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. EC – Assumptions
1. The EC domain model reflects protocol-specified study treatment administrations, as collected.
a. EC should be used in all cases where collected exposure information cannot or should not be directly represented in the Exposure (EX) domain. For example, administrations collected in tablets when the protocol-specified unit is mg, or administrations collected in mL when the protocol-specified unit is mg/kg. Product accountability details (e.g., amount dispensed, amount returned) are represented in the DA domain, not in EC. b. Collected exposure data are in most cases represented in a combination of 1 or more of EC, DA, or Findings About Events or Interventions (FA) domains. If the entire EC dataset is an exact duplicate of the entire EX dataset, then EC is optional and at the sponsor's discretion. c. Collected exposure log data points descriptive of administrations typically reflect amounts at the product-level (e.g., number of tablets, number of mL).
2. Treatment description (ECTRT) is sponsor-defined and should reflect how the protocol-specified study treatment is known or referred to in data
collection. In an open-label study, ECTRT should store the treatment name. In a masked study, if treatment is collected and known as tablet A to the subject or administrator, then ECTRT = "TABLET A". If, in a masked study, the treatment is not known by a synonym and the data are to be exchanged between sponsors, partners, and/or regulatory agency(s), then assign ECTRT the value of "MASKED".
3. ECMOOD is permissible; when implemented, it must be populated for all records.
a. Values of ECMOOD, to date include: i. "SCHEDULED" (for collected subject-level intended dose records) ii. "PERFORMED" (for collected subject-level actual dose records)

| Variable<br>Name | Variable Label | Type | Controlled Terms,<br>Codelist or Format1 | Role | CDISC Notes | Core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ECENDTC | End Date/Time of<br>Treatment | Char | ISO 8601 datetime or<br>interval | Timing | The date/time when administration of the treatment indicated by ECTRT and ECDOSE ended. For | Exp |
|  |  |  |  |  | administrations considered given at a point in time (e.g., oral tablet, pre-filled syringe injection), |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | where only an administration date/time is collected, ECSTDTC should be copied to ECENDTC as the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | standard representation. |  |
| ECSTDY | Study Day of Start of<br>Treatment | Num |  | Timing | Study day of ECSTDTC relative to the sponsor-defined DM.RFSTDTC. | Perm |
| ECENDY | Study Day of End of<br>Treatment | Num |  | Timing | Study day of ECENDTC relative to the sponsor-defined DM.RFSTDTC. | Perm |

| ECELTM | Planned Elapsed Time<br>from Time Point Ref | Char | ISO 8601 duration | Timing | Planned elapsed time relative to the planned fixed reference (ECTPTREF). This variable is useful | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | where there are repetitive measures. Not a clock time. |  |
| ECTPTREF | Time Point Reference | Char |  | Timing | Name of the fixed reference point referred to by ECELTM, ECTPTNUM, and ECTPT. Examples: | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | "PREVIOUS DOSE", "PREVIOUS MEAL". |  |
| ECRFTDTC | Date/Time of<br>Reference Time Point | Char | ISO 8601 datetime or<br>interval | Timing | Date/time for a fixed reference time point defined by ECTPTREF. | Perm |

b. Qualifier variables should be populated with equal granularity across scheduled and performed records when known. For example, if ECDOSU and ECDOSFRQ are known at scheduling and administration, then the variables would be populated on both records. If ECLOC is determined at the time of administration, then it would be populated on the Performed record only. c. Appropriate timing variable(s) should be populated. Note: Details on Scheduled records may describe timing at a higher level than Performed records. d. ECOCCUR is generally not applicable for Scheduled records. e. An activity may be rescheduled or modified multiple times before being performed. Representation of Scheduled records is dependent on the collected, available data. If each rescheduled or modified activity is collected, then multiple Scheduled records may be represented. If only the final scheduled activity is collected, then it would be the only Scheduled record represented.
4. Doses not taken, not given, or missed
a. The record qualifier --OCCUR, with value of "N", is available in domains based on the Interventions and Events General Observation Classes as the standard way to represent whether an intervention or event did not happen. In the EC domain, ECOCCUR value of "N" indicates a dose was not taken, not given, or missed. For example, if zero tablets are taken within a timeframe or zero mL is infused at a visit, then ECOCCUR = "N" is the standard representation of the collected doses not taken, not given, or missed. Dose amount variables (e.g., ECDOSE, ECDOSTXT) must not be set to zero (0) as an alternative method for indicating doses not taken, not given, or missed. b. The population of qualifier variables (e.g., grouping, record) and additional timing variables (e.g., date of collection, visit, time point) for records representing information collected about doses not taken, not given, or missed should be populated with equal granularity as administered records, when known and/or applicable. Qualifiers that indicate dose amount (e.g., ECDOSE, ECDOSTXT) may be populated with positive (non-zero) values in cases where the sponsor feels it is necessary and/or appropriate to represent specific dose amounts not taken, not given, or missed. c. If a reason why a dose was not given is collected, it is represented in ECREASOC, the reason why ECOCCUR = "N".
5. Timing variables
a. Timing variables in the EC domain should reflect administrations by the intervals they were collected (e.g., constant-dosing intervals, visits, targeted dates like first dose, last dose). b. For administrations considered given at a point in time (e.g., oral tablet, pre-filled syringe injection), where only an administration date/time is collected, ECSTDTC should be copied to ECENDTC.
6. The degree of summarization of records from EC to EX is sponsor-defined to support study purpose and analysis. When the relationship between EC
and EX records can be described in RELREC, then it should be defined. EX derivations must be described in the Define-XML document.
7. Additional interventions qualifiers
a. --DOSTOT is under evaluation for potential deprecation and replacement with a mechanism to describe total dose over any interval of time (e.g., day, week, month). Sponsors considering ECDOSTOT may want to consider using other dose amount variables (ECDOSE or ECDOSTXT) in combination with frequency (ECDOSFRQ) and timing variables to represent the data. b. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the EC domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: --STAT and --REASND.

6.1.3.3 Exposure/Exposure as Collected Examples
Example 1 This is an example of a double-blind study comparing drug X extended release (ER; 2 500-mg tablets once daily) vs. drug Z (2 250-mg tablets once daily). Per example CRFs, subject ABC1001 took 2 tablets from 2011-01-14 to 2011-01-28 and subject ABC2001 took 2 tablets within the same timeframe but missed dosing on 2011-01-24. Exposure CRF: Subject: ABC1001 Bottle Number of Tablets Taken Daily Reason for Variation Start Date End Date A 2 2011-01-14 2011-01-28 Subject: ABC2001

Upon unmasking, it became known that subject ABC1001 received drug X and Subject ABC2001 received drug Z. The EC dataset shows the administrations of study treatment as collected. Rows 1-2, 4: Show treatments administered. Row 3: Shows that the zero for Number of Tablets Taken Daily on the CRF was represented as ECOCCUR = "N". The reason this treatment did not occur is represented in ECREASOC. ec.xpt

| Bottle | Number of Tablets Taken Daily | Reason for Variation | Start Date E | nd Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 2 |  | 2011-01-14 2 | 011-01-23 |
| A | 0 | Patient mistake | 2011-01-24 2 | 011-01-24 |
| A | 2 |  | 2011-01-25 2 | 011-01-28 |

The EX dataset shows the unmasked administrations. Two tablets from bottle A became 1000 mg of drug X extended release for subject ABC1001, but 500 mg of drug Z for subject ABC2001. Note that there is no record in the EX dataset for non-occurrence of study treatment. The non-occurrence of study drug for subject ABC2001 is reflected in the gap in time between the 2 EX records. ex.xpt

Example 2 This example shows data from an open-label study. A subject received drug X as a 20 mg/mL solution administered across 3 injection sites to deliver a total dose of 3 mg/kg. The subject's weight was 100 kg. Exposure CRF Visit 3 Date 2009-05-10 Injection 1 Volume Given (mL) 5 Location ABDOMEN Side LEFT Injection 2 Volume Given (mL) 5 Location ABDOMEN Side CENTER Injection 3 Volume Given (mL) 5 Location ABDOMEN Side RIGHT The collected administration amounts, in mL, and their locations are represented in the EC dataset. ec.xpt

The sponsor considered the 3 injections to constitute a single administration, so the EX dataset shows the total dose given in the protocol-specified unit, mg/kg. EXLOC = "ABDOMEN" is included because this location was common to all injections, but EXLAT was not included. If the sponsor had chosen to represent laterality in the EX record, this would have been handled as described in Section 4.2.8.3, Multiple Values for a Non-result Qualifier Variable. ex.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID EXSEQ EXSPID EXLNKID EXTRT EXDOSE EXDOSU EXDOSFRM EXDOSFRQ EXROUTE EXLOC VISITNUM VISIT EPOCH EXSTDTC EXENDTC EXSTDY EXENDY

• Bottle C contained placebo (i.e., 0 mg of active ingredient/tablet)
The EX dataset shows the doses administered in the protocol-specified unit (mg). The sponsor considered an administration to consist of the total amount for bottles A, B, and C. The derivation of EX records from multiple EC records should be shown in the Define-XML document. ex.xpt

Example 4 The study in this example was an open-label study examining the tolerability of different doses of drug A. The study drug was taken orally, daily for 3 months. Dose adjustments were allowed as needed in response to tolerability or efficacy issues. The EX dataset shows administrations collected in the protocol-specified unit, mg. No EC dataset was needed because the open-label administrations were collected in the protocol-specified unit; EC would be an exact duplicate of the entire EX domain. ex.xpt

Example 5 This is an example of a double-blind study design comparing 10 and 20 mg of drug X vs. placebo taken daily, morning and evening, for a week. Subject ABC5001

The EC dataset shows the administrations as collected. The time-point variables ECTPT and ECTPTNUM were used to describe the time of day of administration. This use of time-point variables is novel, representing data about multiple time points, 1 on each day of administration, rather than data for a single time point.

Example 7 The study in this example involved weekly infusions of drug Z 10 mg/kg. If a subject experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the intended dose could be reduced to 7.5 mg/kg. The example CRF below was for subject ABC123-0201, who weighed 55 kg. The CRF shows that:
• The subject's first administration of drug Z was on 2009-02-13; the intended dose was 10 mg/kg, but the actual amount given was 99 mL at 5.5 mg/mL, so the actual dose was 9.9 mg/kg.
• The subject's second administration of drug Z occurred on 2009-02-20; the intended dose was reduced to 7.5 mg/kg due to dose-limiting toxicity, and the infusion was stopped early due to an injection site
reaction. However, the actual amount given was 35 mL at a concentration of 4.12 mg/mL, so the calculated actual dose was 2.6 mg/kg.
• The subject's third administration was intended to occur on 2009-02-27; the intended dose was 7.5 mg/kg but, due to a personal reason, the administration did not occur.

1. The ML domain is used to represent consumption of any food or nutritional item that would not be represented in the exposure domains (EC/EX),
Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM), Procedure Agents (AG), or Substance Use (SU). Examples of nutritional items that would be represented in other domains include: a. Investigational nutritional products (represented in EC/EX) b. Food or drink used to treat hypoglycemic events (represented in CM) c. Glucose given as part of a glucose tolerance test (represented in AG) d. Caffeinated drinks (represented in SU) The nutritional items represented in ML may be prospectively defined within a protocol, collected retrospectively as potential precipitants of clinical events, and/or to describe nutritional intake.

a. Any additional timing variables may be added to this domain. b. Consumption of a food product is considered to occur over an interval of time (as opposed to a point in time). If start and end date/times are collected, they should be represented in MLSTDTC and MLENDTC, respectively. If only a start date/time is collected, it should not be copied to MLENDTC.
3. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the ML domain, but the following qualifiers
would generally not be used: --MOOD, --LOT, --LOC, --LAT, --DIR, --PORTOT. ML – Examples Example 1 This example shows meal data collected in an effort to understand the causes of 2 different kinds of events.
• Data was collected about the last meal before each hypoglycemic event
• Data was collected about the occurrence of of prespecified foods prior to a suspected event of drug-induced liver injury (DILI).
Meal Log CRF Record the last type of meal/food consumption prior to the hypoglycemic event:

DILI Meal CRF If suspected DILI, did you consume any of the following in the past week?

PR – Assumptions
1. Some examples of procedures, by type, include the following:
a. Disease screening (e.g., mammogram, pap smear) b. Endoscopic examinations (e.g., arthroscopy, diagnostic colonoscopy, therapeutic colonoscopy, diagnostic laparoscopy, therapeutic laparoscopy) c. Diagnostic tests (e.g., amniocentesis, biopsy, catheterization, cutaneous oximetry, finger stick, fluorophotometry, imaging techniques (e.g., DXA scan, CT scan, MRI), phlebotomy, pulmonary function test, skin test, stress test, tympanometry) d. Therapeutic procedures (e.g., ablation therapy, catheterization, cryotherapy, mechanical ventilation, phototherapy, radiation therapy/radiotherapy, thermotherapy) e. Surgical procedures (e.g., curative surgery, diagnostic surgery, palliative surgery, therapeutic surgery, prophylactic surgery, resection, stenting, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, implantation) The Procedures domain is based on the Interventions observation class. The extent of physiological effect may range from observable to microscopic. Regardless of the extent of effect or whether it is collected in the study, all collected procedures are represented in this domain. The protocol design should specify whether procedure information will be collected.Measurements obtained from procedures are to be represented in their respective Findings domain(s). For example, a biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample that is then evaluated histopathologically. In this case, details of the biopsy procedure can be represented in the PR domain and the histopathology findings in the Microscopic Findings (MI) domain. Describing the relationship between PR and MI records (in RELREC) in this example is dependent on whether the relationship is collected, either explicitly or implicitly.
2. In the Findings Observation Class, the test method is represented in the --METHOD variable (e.g., electrophoresis, gram stain, polymerase chain
reaction). At times, the test method overlaps with diagnostic/therapeutic procedures (e.g., ultrasound, MRI, x-ray) in-scope for the PR domain. The following is recommended: If timing (start, end or duration) or an indicator populating PROCCUR, PRSTAT, or PRREASND is collected, then a PR record should be created. If only the findings from a procedure are collected, then --METHOD in the Findings domain(s) may be sufficient to reflect the procedure and a related PR record is optional. It is at the sponsor’s discretion whether to represent the procedure as both a test method (--METHOD) and related PR record.
3. PRINDC is used to represent a medical indication, a medical condition which makes a treatment advisable. The reason for a procedure may be
something other than a medical indication. For example, an x-ray might be taken to determine whether a fracture was present. Reasons other than medical indications should be represented using the supplemental qualifier PRREAS (see Appendix C1, Supplemental Qualifiers Name Codes).
4. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or interventions general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the PR domain, but the following
qualifiers would generally not be used: --MOOD, --LOT. PR – Examples Example 1 A procedures log CRF may collect verbatim values (procedure names) and dates performed. This example shows a subject who had 5 procedures collected and represented in the PR domain. In this study, the sponsor chose to consider verbatim text in PRTRT as long text represented in mixed case. See Section 4.2.4, Text Case in Submitted Data.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. SU – Assumptions
1. Substance use information may be independent of planned study evaluations, or may be a key outcome (e.g., planned evaluation) of a clinical trial.
a. In many clinical trials, detailed substance use information as provided for in the domain model above may not be required (e.g., the only information collected may be a response to the question “Have you ever smoked tobacco?”); in such cases, many of the qualifier variables would not be submitted. b. SU may contain responses to questions about use of prespecified substances as well as records of substance use collected as free text.
2. SU description and coding
a. SUTRT captures the verbatim or the prespecified text collected for the substance. It is the topic variable for the SU dataset. SUTRT is a required variable and must have a value. b. SUMODIFY is a permissible variable and should be included if coding is performed and the sponsor’s procedure permits modification of a verbatim substance use term for coding. The modified term is listed in SUMODIFY. The variable may be populated as per the sponsor’s procedures. c. SUDECOD is the preferred term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary if coding is performed. It is a permissible variable. Where deemed necessary by the sponsor, the verbatim term (SUTRT) should be coded using a standard dictionary such as WHO Drug. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document.
3. Additional categorization and grouping
a. SUCAT and SUSCAT should not be redundant with the domain code or dictionary classification provided by SUDECOD, or with SUTRT. That is, they should provide a different means of defining or classifying SU records. For example, a sponsor may be interested in identifying all substances that the investigator feels might represent opium use, and to collect such use on a separate CRF page. This categorization might differ from the categorization derived from the coding dictionary. b. SUGRPID may be used to link (or associate) different records together to form a block of related records within SU at the subject level (see Section 4.2.6, Grouping Variables and Categorization). It should not be used in place of SUCAT or SUSCAT.
4. Timing variables
a. SUSTDTC and SUENDTC may be populated as required. b. If substance use information is collected more than once within the CRF (indicating that the data are visit-based) then VISITNUM would be added to the domain as an additional timing variable. VISITDY and VISIT would then be permissible variables.

5. Any additional qualifiers from the Interventions class may be added to the SU domain, but the following qualifiers would generally not be used: --
MOOD, --LOT. SU – Examples Example 1 This example illustrates how typical SU data could be populated. Here, the CRF collected:
• Smoking data
o Smoking status of "previous", "current", or "never"
o If a current or past smoker, number of packs per day
o If a former smoker, the year the subject quit
• Current caffeine use
o What caffeine drinks subjects consumed today
o How many cups today
SUCAT allows the records to be grouped into smoking-related data and caffeine-related data. In this example, the treatments are prespecified on the CRF page, so SUTRT does not require a standardized SUDECOD equivalent. Not shown: A subject who never smoked does not have a tobacco record. Alternatively, a row for the subject could have been included with SUOCCUR = "N" and null dosing and timing fields; the interpretation would be the same. A subject who did not drink any caffeinated drinks on the day of the assessment does not have any caffeine records. A subject who never smoked and did not drink caffeinated drinks on the day of the assessment does not appear in the dataset. Row 1: Subject 1234005 is a 2-pack/day current smoker. “Current” implies that smoking started sometime before the time the question was asked (SUSTTPT = "2006-01-01", SUSTRTPT = "BEFORE") and had not ended as of that date (SUENTTP = "2006-01-01", SUENRTPT = "ONGOING"). See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables for the use of these variables. Both the beginning and ending reference time points for this question are the date of the assessment. Row 2: Subject 1234005 drank 3 cups of coffee on the day of the assessment. Row 3: Subject 1234006 is a former smoker. The date this subject began smoking is unknown, but it was sometime before the assessment date; this is shown by the values of SUSTTPT and SUSTRTPT. The end date of smoking was collected, so SUENTPT and SUENRTPT are not populated. Instead, the end date is in SUENDTC. Row 4: Subject 1234006 drank tea on the day of the assessment. Row 5: Subject 1234006 drank coffee on the day of the assessment. Row 6: Subject 1234007 had missing data for the smoking questions; this is indicated by SUSTAT = "NOT DONE". The reason is in SUREASND. Row 7: Subject 1234007 also had missing data for all of the caffeine questions.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. AE – Assumptions
1. The Adverse Events dataset includes clinical data describing "any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment" (ICH E2A). In consultation with regulatory authorities, sponsors may extend or limit the scope of adverse event collection (e.g., collecting pre-treatment events related to trial conduct, not collecting events that are assessed as efficacy endpoints). The events included in the AE dataset should be consistent with the protocol requirements. Adverse events may be captured either as free text or via a prespecified list of terms.
2. AE description and coding
a. AETERM captures the verbatim term collected for the event. It is the topic variable for the AE dataset. AETERM is a required variable and must have a value. b. AEMODIFY is a permissible variable and should be included if the sponsor’s procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. The modified term is listed in AEMODIFY. The variable should be populated as per the sponsor’s procedures. c. AEDECOD is the preferred term derived by the sponsor from the coding dictionary. It is a required variable and must have a value. It is expected that the reported term (AETERM) will be coded using a standard dictionary such as MedDRA. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document.

d. AEBODSYS is the system organ class (SOC) from the coding dictionary associated with the adverse event by the sponsor. This value may differ from the primary SOC designated in the coding dictionary's standard hierarchy. It is expected that this variable will be populated.
3. Additional categorization and grouping
a. AECAT and AESCAT should not be redundant with the domain code or dictionary classification provided by AEDECOD and AEBODSYS (i.e., they should provide a different means of defining or classifying AE records). AECAT and AESCAT are intended for categorizations that are defined in advance. For example, a sponsor may have a CRF page for AEs of special interest and another page for all other AEs. AECAT and AESCAT should not be used for after-the-fact categorizations such as "clinically significant." In cases where a category of AEs of special interest resembles a part of the dictionary hierarchy (e.g., "CARDIAC EVENTS"), the categorization represented by AECAT and AESCAT may differ from the categorization derived from the coding dictionary. b. AEGRPID may be used to link (or associate) different records together to form a block of related records at the subject level within the AE domain; see Section 4.2.6, Grouping Variables and Categorization.
4. Prespecified terms; presence or absence of events
a. Adverse events are generally collected in 2 different ways, either by recording free text or using a prespecified list of terms. In the latter case, the solicitation of information on specific adverse events may affect the frequency at which they are reported; therefore, the fact that a specific adverse event was solicited may be of interest to reviewers. An AEPRESP value of “Y” is used to indicate that the event in AETERM was prespecified on the CRF. b. If it is important to know which adverse events from a prespecified list were not reported as well as those that did occur, these data should be submitted in a Findings class dataset such as Findings About Events and Interventions (see Section 6.4, Findings About Events or Interventions). A record should be included in that Findings dataset for each prespecified adverse-event term. Records for adverse events that actually occurred should also exist in the AE dataset with AEPRESP set to “Y.” c. If a study collects both prespecified adverse events and free-text events, the value of AEPRESP should be “Y” for all prespecified events and null for events reported as free text. AEPRESP is a permissible field and may be omitted from the dataset if all adverse events were collected as free text. d. When adverse events are collected with the recording of free text, a record may be entered into the sponsor’s data management system to indicate “no adverse events” for a specific subject. For these subjects, do not include a record in the AE submission dataset to indicate that there were no events. Records should be included in the submission AE dataset only for adverse events that have actually occurred.
5. Timing variables
a. Relative timing assessment “Ongoing” is common in the collection of AE information. AEENRF may be used when this relative timing assessment is made coincident with the end of the study reference period for the subject represented in the Demographics (DM) dataset (RFENDTC). AEENRTPT with AEENTPT may be used when "Ongoing" is relative to another date (e.g., the final safety follow-up visit date). See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables. b. Additional timing variables (e.g., AEDTC) may be used when appropriate.
6. Actions taken


## Page 139

a. AECONTRT is a Y/N variable. If the non-study treatment is collected, the name and other information about the treatment should be represented in the appropriate Interventions domain—usually Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) or Procedures (PR)—and linked to the AE record with RELREC. b. Actions other than concomitant treatments are recorded in: ▪ AEACN, only for actions taken with study treatment ▪ AEACNDEV, for actions with a device ▪ AEACNOTH, for actions that do not involve treatment or a device
7. Other qualifier variables
a. If categories of serious events are collected secondarily to a leading question the values of the variables that capture reasons an event is considered serious (e.g., AESCAN, AESCONG) may be null: For example, if "Serious?" is answered "No", the values for these variables may be null. However, if "Serious?" is answered "Yes", at least one of them will have a “Y” response. Others may be "N" or null, according to the sponsor’s convention. Serious? [ ] Yes [ ] No If yes, check all that apply [ ] Fatal [ ] Life-threatening [ ] Inpatient hospitalization… [ ] etc. On the other hand, if the CRF is structured so that a response is collected for each seriousness category, all category variables (e.g., AESDTH, AESHOSP) would be populated and AESER would be derived. b. The serious categories “Involves cancer” (AESCAN) and “Occurred with overdose” (AESOD) are not part of the ICH definition of a serious adverse event, but these categories are available for use in studies conducted under guidelines that existed prior to the FDA’s adoption of the ICH definition. c. When a description of "Other Medically Important Serious Adverse Events" category is collected on a CRF, sponsors should place the description in the SUPPAE dataset using the standard supplemental qualifier name code AESOSP as described in Section 8.4, Relating Non-Standard Variables Values to a Parent Domain, and in Appendix C1, Supplemental Qualifiers Name Codes. d. In studies using toxicity grade according to a standard toxicity scale such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), published by the National Cancer Institute (NCI; available at https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/), AETOXGR should be used instead of AESEV. In most cases, either AESEV or AETOXGR is populated but not both. There may be cases when a sponsor may need to populate both variables. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document. e. The structure of the AE domain is 1 record per adverse event per subject. It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an event. This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for characterizing and reporting product safety and is usually described in the protocol. For example, the sponsor may submit 1 record that covers an adverse event from start to finish. Alternatively, if there is a need to evaluate AEs at a more granular level, a sponsor may submit a new record when severity, causality, or seriousness changes or worsens. By submitting these individual records, the sponsor indicates that each is considered to represent a different event. The submission dataset structure may differ from the structure at the time of collection. For example, a sponsor might collect data at each visit in order to meet operational needs, but submit records that summarize the event and contain the highest level of severity, causality, seriousness, and so on. Examples of dataset structure include:


## Page 140

i. One record per adverse event per subject for each unique event. Multiple adverse event records reported by the investigator are submitted as summary records “collapsed” to the highest level of severity, causality, seriousness, and the final outcome. ii. One record per adverse event per subject. Changes over time in severity, causality, or seriousness are submitted as separate events. Alternatively, these changes may be submitted in a separate dataset based on the Findings About Events and Interventions model (see Section 6.4, Findings About Events or Interventions). iii. Other approaches may also be reasonable as long as they meet the sponsor's safety evaluation requirements and each submitted record represents a unique event. The domain-level metadata (see Section 3.2, Using the CDISC Domain Models in Regulatory Submissions – Dataset Metadata) should clarify the structure of the dataset.
8. Use of EPOCH and TAETORD: When EPOCH is included in the AE domain, it should be the epoch of the start of the adverse event. In other words, it
should be based on AESTDTC, rather than AEENDTC. The computational method for EPOCH in the Define-XML document should describe any assumptions made to handle cases where an adverse event starts on the same day that a subject starts an epoch, if AESTDTC and SESTDTC are not captured with enough precision to determine the epoch of the onset of the adverse event unambiguously. Similarly, if TAETORD is included in the AE domain, it should be the value for the start of the adverse event, and the computational method in the Define-XML document should describe any assumptions.
9. Any additional identifier variables may be added to the AE domain.
10. The following qualifiers would not be used in AE: --OCCUR, --STAT, and--REASND. They are the only qualifiers from the SDTM Events class not in
the AE domain. They are not permitted because the AE domain contains only records for adverse events that actually occurred. See Assumption 4b for information on how to deal with negative responses or missing responses to probing questions for prespecified adverse events.
11. Variable order in the domain should follow the rules as described in Section 4.1.4, Order of the Variables, and the order described in Section 1.1,
Purpose.
12. The addition of AELLT, AELLTCD, AEPTCD, AEHLT, AEHLTCD, AEHLGT, AEHLGTCD, AEBDSYCD, AESOC, and AESOCCD is applicable to
submissions coded in MedDRA only. Data items are not expected for non-MedDRA coding. AE – Examples Example 1 This example illustrates data from an AE CRF that collected AE terms as free text. AEs were coded using MedDRA, and the sponsor’s procedures include the possibility of modifying the reported term to aid in coding. The CRF was structured so that seriousness category variables (e.g., AESDTH, AESHOSP) were checked only when AESER is answered “Y.” In this study, the study reference period started at the start of study treatment. Three AEs were reported for this subject. Rows 1-2: Show examples of modifying the reported term for coding purposes, with the modified term in AEMODIFY. These adverse events were not serious, so the seriousness criteria variables are null. Note that for the event in row 2, AESTDY = "1". Day 1 was the day treatment started; the AE start and end times, as well as dates, were collected to allow comparison of the AE timing to the start of treatment. Row 3: Shows an example of the overall seriousness question AESER answered with "Y" and the relevant corresponding seriousness category variables (AESHOSP and AESLIFE) answered "Y". The other seriousness category variables are left blank. This row also shows AEENRF being populated because the AE was marked as “Continuing” as of the end of the study reference period for the subject (see Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables).

Example 2 In this example, a CRF module included at several visits asked whether nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea occurred. The responses to the probing questions "Yes", "No", or "Not Done" were represented in the Findings About (FA) domain (see Section 6.4, Findings About Events or Interventions). If “Yes”, the investigator was instructed to complete the AE CRF. In the AE dataset, data on AEs solicited via prespecification on the CRF have an AEPRESP value of "Y". For AEs solicited by a general question, AEPRESP is null. RELREC may be used to relate AE records and FA records. Rows 1-2: Show that nausea and vomiting were prespecified on a CRF, as indicated by AEPRESP = "Y". The subject did not experience diarrhea, so no record for that term exists in the AE dataset. Row 3: Shows an example of an AE (headache) that was not prespecified on a CRF, as indicated by a null value for AEPRESP. ae.xpt

Example 3 In this example, a CRF module that asked whether or not nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea occurred was included in the study only once. In the context of this study, the conditions that occurred were reportable as adverse events. No additional data about these events was collected. No other AE information was collected via general questions. The responses to the probing questions "Yes", "No", or "Not Done" were represented in the FA domain (see Section 6.4, Findings About Events or Interventions). This is an example of unusually sparse AE data collection; the AE dataset is populated with the term and the flag indicating that it was prespecified, but timing information is limited to the date of collection, and other expected qualifiers are not available. RELREC may be used to relate AE records and FA records. The subject shown in this example experienced nausea and vomiting. The subject did not experience diarrhea, so no record for that term exists in the AE dataset. ae.xpt

Example 4 In this example, the investigator was instructed to create a new AE record each time the severity of an adverse event changed. The sponsor used AEGRPID to identify the group of records related to a single event for a subject. Row 1: Shows an adverse event of nausea, for which severity was moderate. Rows 2-4: Show AEGRPID used to group records related to a single event of "VOMITING". Rows 5-6: Show AEGRPID used to group records related to a single event of "DIARRHEA".

Example 5 This study was evaluating artificial hip joints made of a novel material. The protocol specified that only 1 hip could be replaced in a subject, and that subjects should be encouraged to begin walking within 2 days after surgery. This subject was walking on day 5 and tripped and sprained her left ankle. A few days later, she developed an infection in the hip bone adjacent to the implant. The implant was removed and replaced by a different product. She never regained full use of her hip, and was left with a limp. This example shows the use of the device-related variables indicating if the AE was unanticipated (AEUNANT), if it was related to the procedure that implanted the device rather than the device itself (AERLPRC), or if it was related to some other procedure or activity required by the protocol (AERLPRT). These are used to determine if the AE was an unanticipated serious device event, a designation required by some regulatory authorities. Device Identifiers (DI) and other related device domains have not been modeled here; for more information about device domains, see the SDTMIG-MD (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/medical-devices). Row 1: Shows an AE of "Twisted left ankle". The location and laterality are specified as it may be important to know if it occurred on the same or opposite side of the body. Row 2: Shows an AE of "Osteomyelitis right hip". The location and laterality are specified and it is considered a serious adverse event. The device was removed as the AE was probably related to the event. ae.xpt

Example 6 This study was testing an implanted cardiac pacemaker that was paired with a transmitting sensor that was attached to the participant's skin. The sensor picked up transmitted measurements from the pacemaker and relayed them to a cell network and then to the subject's and investigator's smart phones. The devices were the focus of the study. The DI domain and other related device domains have not been modeled here; for further information about the device domains, see the SDTMIG-MD. Row 1: Shows the use of the variables for the relationship of the device to the AE (AERLDEV), and the action taken with the device as a result of the AE (AEACNDEV). The sponsor has chosen to use the ISO
14155 controlled terminology for Relationship of AE to Device. The sensor attachment to the skin caused some skin irritation, which was considered to be caused by the device; the action taken was to
reposition the device, and the subject recovered. Row 2: Shows an adverse event of infection at the sensor site. In the Microbiology Specimen (MB) domain (not shown), a record shows that the infection was caused by a microbe with partial resistance to common antibiotics, and so the subject was hospitalized to receive intravenous treatment. The event was considered to be probably related to the device, and was serious. The seriousness criteria included hospitalization, and the device-specific criterion of requiring intervention to prevent progression to life-threatening or fatal conditions (AESINTV). ae.xpt

6.2.2 Biospecimen Events (BE)
BE, BS, and RELSPEC domain specifications, assumptions, and examples were copied and minimally updated from the provisional SDTMIG-PGx, published 2015-05-26. This was done in preparation for the retirement of the SDTMIG-PGx upon publication of SDTMIG v3.4. These domains are currently under extensive revision for inclusion in a future SDTMIG publication, after v3.4. BE – Description/Overview An events domain that documents actions taken that affect or may affect a specimen (e.g., specimen collection, freezing and thawing, aliquoting, transportation). BE – Specification be.xpt, Biospecimen Events — Events. One record per instance per biospecimen event per biospecimen identifier per subject, Tabulation.

BE – Assumptions
1. The BE domain contains data about actions taken that affect or may affect a specimen, such as specimen collection, freezing and thawing, aliquoting,
and transportation. This domain is intended to be applicable to any specimen tracking data, regardless of the reason for specimen collection.
2. The value in BEREFID identifies the specimen most affected by the event. For aliquoting, this would be the child specimen(s) created by the event,
rather than the parent specimen. BEREFID should not contain any identifiers other than specimen IDs.
3. BELOC holds the relevant anatomic location of the subject, so it should only be populated when the subject participates in and is directly affected by the
event given in BETERM.
4. BEPARTY and BEPRTYID together identify the individual or organization that takes responsibility for the biospecimen as a result of the action in
BETERM. For example, if BETERM is COLLECTED, BEPARTY would be a general term defining the type of responsible party, such as SITE, and BEPRTYID would contain the site identifier, such as 02. If BEPARTY is sufficient to uniquely identify the party (such as SPONSOR in a singlesponsor study), then BEPRTYID may be null.
5. Usually BEPARTY and BEPRTYID refer to who has possession of the biospecimen after the action in BETERM. In the cases where a biospecimen is
lost or destroyed for example, BEPARTY and BEPRTYID may be null.
6. Timing variables:
a. BESTDTC and BEENDTC hold the start and end date/times for the event given in BETERM. If the end date/time is the same as the start date/time for the event, then BEENDTC is null. b. Unlike other Events domains, BEDTC does not hold the date/time of data collection. Instead, it holds the date/time of specimen collection, in alignment with the use of --DTC for specimen-related findings. BEDTC values for extracted or otherwise derived specimens are copied from that of the parent specimen.

c. VISITNUM, VISIT, and VISITDY values for all records refer to the visit in which the originally collected specimen was collected.
7. The following variables generally would not be used in BE: dictionary coding variables (--LLT, --LLTCD, --PTCD, --HLT, --HLTCD, --HLGT, --
HLGTCD), AE-specific variables (--SEV, --SER, --ACN, --ACNOTH, --ACNDEV, --REL, --RELNST, --PATT, --OUT, --SCAN, --SCONG, -- SDISAB, --SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, --SMIE, --CONTRT), toxicity variables (--TOX, --TOXGR). BE – Examples Example 1 In this example, a specimen is collected, flash frozen, thawed, and shipped to another location. Some tests are very sensitive to specimen handling processes such as flash freezing or time spent in transit. Therefore, it is important to record when the processes were started and completed. Such information is recorded in the BE domain. Row 1: Shows specimen collection. The value in SPDEVID for this row identifies the vessel into which the specimen is collected. Rows 2-4: Show the start and end date/times of flash freezing, storing while frozen, and thawing. The value in SPDEVID for row 3 identifies the freezer in which the specimen is stored. Row 5: Records the transportation of a biospecimen. Because there is only one ABC Lab, BEPRTYID is null. The value in SPDEVID for this row identifies the shipping container. be.xpt

Findings related to specimen handling processes are stored in the Biospecimen (BS) domain. These processes can be important to maintain the integrity of the specimens used in genetic variation and gene expression testing. Depending on how a study is designed, there might be very specific specimen handling specifications contained in the protocol for all labs to follow. Other protocols may let the labs determine the processes to follow. This example illustrates the latter approach. Row 1: Shows the volume of the biospecimen. Rows 2-3: Show the flash freeze temperature and material, associated via RELREC with BE row 2.

Example 2 Cell-free RNA, which can be obtained from plasma, may be useful for some tumor-specific cancer detection,[1] but has poor integrity.[2]In this example, a blood sample was drawn, centrifuged to get plasma, and stored in a pretreated container before being shipped to the lab. The lab then extracted and purified RNA from the plasma, divided the RNA into 3 aliquots, and sequenced 1 aliquot immediately while freezing and storing the other 2 for later use. Row 1: Shows the collection of the blood sample. Row 2: Shows the extraction of the plasma via centrifuge. BESPDEVID holds the identifier for the container into which the plasma is placed. (Not shown: any preservatives with which the container comes pretreated, which would be stored in the Device Properties (DO) domain.) Row 3: Shows the transportation of the plasma from the site to the lab. Row 4: Shows the extraction of the RNA, which includes purification and quality control testing to make sure the sample is of a high enough quality to be viable. BESPDEVID holds the identifier for the purification kit. Rows 5-7: Show the aliquoting of the RNA. Row 8: Shows the sequencing of the first RNA aliquot. (Not shown: results from sequencing, which would be stored in the Pharmacogenomics Findings (PF) domain.) Rows 9-10: Show the freezing of the second and third RNA aliquots. be.xpt

The specimen type is given in a supplemental qualifier that mimics the standard findings variable --SPEC, and draws from the 2 codelists (GENSMP and SPECTYPE) for its values, depending on whether or not the biospecimen is a sample of the subject's genetic material. Rows 1-2: Give the specimen types for the first 2 specimens as blood and plasma, respectively. These values come from the SPECTYPE codelist. Rows 3-6: Give the specimen type for all subsequent specimens as RNA. "RNA" is one of the terms in the GENSMP codelist. suppbe.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. CE – Assumptions
1. The determination of events to be considered clinical events versus adverse events should be done carefully and with reference to regulatory guidelines
or consultation with a regulatory review division. Events of clinical interest as defined by the protocol that are not considered AEs should be reflected as CEs. a. Events considered to be clinical events may include episodes of symptoms of the disease under study (often known as "signs and symptoms"), or events that do not constitute adverse events in themselves, though they might lead to the identification of an adverse event. For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for migraine headaches, migraine headaches may not be considered to be adverse events per protocol. The occurrence of migraines or associated signs and symptoms might be reported in CE. b. In vaccine trials, certain adverse events may be considered to be signs or symptoms and accordingly determined to be clinical events. If any event is considered serious, then the serious variable (--SER) and the serious adverse event flags (--SCAN, --SCONG, --SDTH, --SHOSP, --SDISAB, -- SLIFE, --SOD, --SMIE) would be required in the CE domain. c. Other studies might track the occurrence of specific events as efficacy endpoints. For example, in a study of an investigational treatment for prevention of ischemic stroke, all occurrences of TIA, stroke, and death might be captured as clinical events and assessed as to whether they meet endpoint criteria. Note that other information about these events may be reported in other datasets. For example, the event leading to death would be reported in AE; death would also be a reason for study discontinuation in the Disposition (DS) domain.
2. CEOCCUR and CEPRESP are used together to indicate whether the event in CETERM was prespecified and whether it occurred. CEPRESP can be
used to separate records that correspond to probing questions for prespecified events from those that represent spontaneously reported events, whereas CEOCCUR contains the responses to such questions. The following table shows how these variables are populated in various situations.

| Variable<br>Name | Variable Label | Type | Controlled Terms,<br>Codelist or<br>Format1 | Role | CDISC Notes | Core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CESTTPT | Start Reference Time<br>Point | Char |  | Timing | Description or date/time in ISO 8601 character format of the sponsor-defined reference point referred to | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | by --STRTPT. Examples: "2003-12-15", "VISIT 1". |  |
| CEENRTPT | End Relative to<br>Reference Time Point | Char | (STENRF) | Timing I | dentifies the end of the observation as being before or after the sponsor-defined reference time point | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | defined by variable CEENTPT. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Not all values of the codelist are allowable for this variable. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Variables. |  |
| CEENTPT | End Reference Time<br>Point | Char |  | Timing | Description or date/time in ISO 8601 character format of the reference point referred to by CEENRTPT. | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | Examples: "2003-12-25", "VISIT 2". |  |

3. The collection of write-in events on a CE CRF should be considered with caution. Sponsors must ensure that all adverse events are recorded in the AE
domain.
4. Any identifier variable may be added to the CE domain.

5. Timing variables
a. Relative timing assessments "Prior" or “Ongoing” are common in the collection of CE information. CESTRF or CEENRF may be used when this timing assessment is relative to the study reference period for the subject represented in the Demographics (DM) dataset (RFENDTC). CESTRTPT with CESTTPT and/or CEENRTPT with CEENTPT may be used when "Prior" or "Ongoing" are relative to specific dates other than the start and end of the study reference period. See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables. b. Additional timing variables may be used when appropriate.
6. The clinical events domain is based on the Events general observation class and thus can use any variables in the Events class, including those found in
the AE domain specification table. CE – Examples Example 1 In this example, data were collected about prespecified events that, in the context of this study, were not reportable as AEs. The data were collected in a log independent of visits, rather than in visit-based CRF modules, so visit and date of collection (CEDTC) data were not collected. CRF

Rows 1-3: Show 3 symptoms which occurred and their start dates. Row 4: Shows that conjunctivitis did not occur. Because there was no event, there is no start date. ce.xpt

| Record start dates of any of the following signs that occurred during the study. |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clinical Sign | Did it occur? | Start Date of First Episode |
| Rash | No<br>Yes |  |
| Wheezing | No<br>Yes |  |
| Edema | No<br>Yes |  |
| Conjunctivitis | No<br>Yes |  |

Example 2 In this example, the CRF included both questions about prespecified clinical events (events not reportable as AEs in the context of this study) and places for specifying additional clinical events. No explicit evaluation interval is given, but the implicit time frame for the question is "during the study." Although this example CRF shows only 1 row for each symptom, if a symptom occurred more than once, data would be collected for each time it occurred. These data are about the event as a whole, so they are represented in the CE domain.

In this example, the use of "Other, Specify" for clinical events is likely to require manual review of the data, to be sure that none of the write-in terms should have been reported as adverse events based on the sponsor's criteria for this study. CRF

Rows 1-2: Show records for 2 instances of the prespecified clinical event, nausea. The CEPRESP value of "Y" indicates that there was a probing question; the response to the probe (CEOCCUR) was "Yes". CEPRESP and CEOCCUR are included in both records for "Nausea". The record includes additional data about the event. Row 3: Shows a record for the prespecified clinical event, vomit. The CEPRESP value of "Y" indicates that there was a probing question; the response to the question (CEOCCUR) was "No". Because there was no event, severity and start and end dates are null. Row 4: Shows a record for the prespecified clinical event, diarrhea. The value "Y" for CEPRESP indicates it was prespecified. The CESTAT value of NOT DONE indicates that the probing question was not asked or that there was no answer. Row 5: Shows a record for a write-in clinical event recorded in the "Other, Specify" space. Because this event was not prespecified, CEPRESP and CEOCCUR are null. See Section 4.2.7.3, "Specify" Values for Topic Variables,for further information on populating the topic variable when "Other, Specify" is used on the CRF. ce.xpt

Example 3 In this study, a prior fracture in the previous 5 years was a requirement for study entry. Details about bone-fracture events were collected about pre-study fractures in the previous 5 years, and about any fracture events that occurred during the study.

Data about the most recent pre-study fracture were represented in the Medical History (MH) domain, and data about fractures during the study were represented in the CE domain. The supplemental qualifier MHCAUSE or CECAUSE (depending on domain) was used to represent the response to the question, "How did the fracture occur?" The supplemental qualifier MHCPLIND or CECPLIND (depending on domain) was used to represent the response to the question, "Were there any complications of the fracture?" The codelist used for AECONTRT (NY) was used for MHCONTRT and CECONTRT. Row 1: The subject had only 1 fracture in the last 5 years. This fracture required treatment (MHCONTRT = "Y"). Row 2: This subject had a complication (see supplemental qualifier MHCPLIND in suppmh.xpt dataset), which was represented as a separate medical history event. MHGRPID was used to group this with the fracture for which it was a complication. No separate start date for this complication was collected, so MHSTDTC is blank. mh.xpt

The therapeutic measures in this example were procedures represented in the Procedures (PR) domain. PRSTDTC is an expected variable, so it is included in the dataset, although it was not collected in this study. Row 1: The subject's pre-study fracture required one of the prespecified therapeutic procedures. The sponsor populated PRSPID with the value in MHSPID for the fracture. PRDTC is populated with the date on which medical history was collected, which also appeared in MHDTC. Rows 2-3: The subject's first on-study fracture required 2 of the prespecified therapeutic procedures. For these procedures, PRSPID was populated with a CESPID value. PRDTC is the same as CEDTC for the associated fracture. pr.xpt

The therapeutic measures are linked to the fracture events in the RELREC dataset. The sponsor anticipated the need to link procedures either to an MH record or a CE record, so included domain prefixes in the values of MHSPID and CESPID and used those in populating PRSPID.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. DS – Assumptions
1. The Disposition (DS) dataset provides an accounting for all subjects who entered the study and may include protocol milestones, such as randomization,
as well as the subject's completion status or reason for discontinuation for the entire study or each phase or segment of the study, including screening and post-treatment follow-up. Sponsors may choose which disposition events and milestones to submit for a study. See ICH E3, Section 10.1, for information about disposition events.
2. Categorization
a. DSCAT is used to distinguish between disposition events, protocol milestones, and other events. The controlled terminology for DSCAT consists of "DISPOSITION EVENT", "PROTOCOL MILESTONE", and "OTHER EVENT". b. An event with DSCAT = “DISPOSITION EVENT” describes either disposition of study participation or of a study treatment. It describes whether a subject completed study participation or a study treatment and, if not, the reason they did not complete it. Dispositions may be described for each epoch (e.g., screening, initial treatment, washout, cross-over treatment, follow-up) or for the study as a whole. If disposition events for both study participation and study treatment(s) are to be represented, then DSSCAT provides this distinction. For records with DSCAT = "DISPOSITION EVENT", i. DSSCAT = "STUDY PARTICIPATION" is used to represent disposition of study participation. ii. DSSCAT = "STUDY TREATMENT" is used when a study has only a single treatment. iii. If a study has multiple treatments, then DSSCAT should name the individual treatment. c. DSSCAT may be used when DSCAT = "PROTOCOL MILESTONE" or "OTHER EVENT", but would be subject to additional CDISC Controlled Terminology. d. An event with DSCAT = “PROTOCOL MILESTONE” is a protocol-specified, point-in-time event. Common protocol milestones include “INFORMED CONSENT OBTAINED” and “RANDOMIZED.” DSSCAT may be used for subcategories of protocol milestones. e. An event with DSCAT = "OTHER EVENT" is another important event that occurred during a trial, but was not driven by protocol requirements and was not captured in another Events or Interventions class dataset. “TREATMENT UNBLINDED” is an example of an event that would be represented with DSCAT = “OTHER EVENT”.

f. Associations between DSCAT and some DSDECOD codelist values are described in the DS Codetable (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology).
3. DS description and coding
a. DSDECOD values are drawn from controlled terminology. The controlled terminology depends on the value of DSCAT. b. When DSCAT = "DISPOSITION EVENT" DSTERM contains either "COMPLETED" or, if the subject did not complete, specific verbatim information about the reason for non-completion. i. When DSTERM = "COMPLETED", DSDECOD is the term "COMPLETED" from the Controlled Terminology codelist NCOMPLT. ii. When DSTERM contains verbatim text, DSDECOD will use the extensible Controlled Terminology codelist NCOMPLT. For example, DSTERM = "Subject moved" might be coded to DSDECOD = "LOST TO FOLLOW-UP". c. When DSCAT = "PROTOCOL MILESTONE", DSTERM contains the verbatim (as collected) and/or standardized text, DSDECOD will use the extensible Controlled Terminology codelist PROTMLST. d. When DSCAT = “OTHER EVENT”, DSDECOD uses sponsor terminology. i. If a reason for the event was collected, the reason for the event is in DSTERM and the DSDECOD is a term from sponsor terminology. For example, if treatment was unblinded due to investigator error, this might be represented in a record with DSTERM = "INVESTIGATOR ERROR" and DSDECOD = "TREATMENT UNBLINDED". ii. If no reason was collected, then DSTERM should be populated with the value in DSDECOD.
4. Timing variables
a. DSSTDTC is expected and is used for the date/time of the disposition event. Events represented in the DS domain do not have end dates; disposition events do not span an interval, but rather occur at a single date/time (e.g., randomization date, disposition of study participation or study treatment). b. DSSTDTC documents the date/time that a protocol milestone, disposition event, or other event occurred. For an event with DSCAT = "DISPOSITION EVENT" where DSTERM is not "COMPLETED", the reason for non-completion may be related to an observation reported in another dataset. DSSTDTC is the date/time that the Epoch was completed and is not necessarily the same as the date/time, start date/time, or end date/time of the observation that led to discontinuation. For example, a subject reported severe vertigo on June 1, 2006 (AESTDTC). After ruling out other possible causes, the investigator decided to discontinue study treatment on June 6, 2006 (DSSTDTC). The subject reported that the vertigo had resolved on June 8, 2006 (AEENDTC). c. EPOCH may be included as a timing variable as in other general observation-class domains. In DS, EPOCH is based on DSSTDTC. The values of EPOCH are drawn from the Trial Arms (TA) dataset (see Section 7.2.1, Trial Arms).
5. Reasons for termination: ICH E3 Section 10.1 indicates that “the specific reason for discontinuation” should be presented, and that summaries should be
“grouped by treatment and by major reason.” The CDISC SDS Team interprets this guidance as requiring 1 standardized disposition term (DSDECOD) per disposition event. If multiple reasons are reported, the sponsor should identify a primary reason and use that to populate DSTERM and DSDECOD. Additional reasons should be submitted in SUPPDS.


## Page 158

For example, in a case where DSTERM = "SEVERE NAUSEA" and DSDECOD = "ADVERSE EVENT", the supplemental qualifiers dataset might include records with SUPPDS QNAM = "DSTERM1", SUPPDS QLABEL = "Reported Term for Disposition Event 1", and SUPPDS QVAL = "SUBJECT REFUSED FURTHER TREATMENT" SUPPDS QNAM = "DSDECOD1", SUPPDS QLABEL = "Standardized Disposition Term 1", and SUPPDS QVAL = "WITHDREW CONSENT"
6. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or Events general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the DS domain, but the following Qualifiers
would generally not be used: --PRESP, --OCCUR, --STAT, --REASND, --BODSYS, --LOC, --SEV, --SER, ‑‑ACN, ‑‑ACNOTH, --REL, --RELNST, -- PATT, --OUT, --SCAN, --SCONG, --SDISAB, --SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, --SMIE, ‑‑CONTRT, --TOXGR. DS – Examples Example 1 In this example, disposition of study participation was collected for each epoch of a trial. Disposition of study participation is indicated by DSCAT = "DISPOSITION EVENT". EPOCH was taken from the CRF, which asked about completion of each epoch of the study. Data about disposition of study treatment was not collected, but the sponsor populated DSSCAT with "STUDY PARTICIPATION" to emphasize that these represent disposition of study participation. Data were also collected about several protocol milestones represented with DSCAT = "PROTOCOL MILESTONE". Rows 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18: Show records for protocol milestones. DSTERM and DSDECOD are populated with the same value, the name of the milestone. Note that for randomization events, EPOCH = "SCREENING", because randomization occurred before the start of treatment, during the screening epoch. Rows 3-5: Show 3 records for a subject who completed 3 stages of the study ("SCREENING", "TREATMENT", "FOLLOW-UP"). Row 7: Shows disposition of a subject who was a screen failure. The verbatim reason the subject was a screen failure is represented in DSTERM. Because the subject did not complete the screening epoch, DSDECOD is not “COMPLETED” but another appropriate controlled term, "PROTOCOL VIOLATION". The date of discontinuation is in DSSTDTC. The protocol deviation event itself would be represented in the DV dataset. Rows 10-11: Show disposition of a subject who completed the screening stage but did not complete the treatment stage. For completed epochs, both DSTERM and DSDECOD are "COMPLETED". For epochs that were not completed, the verbatim reason for non-completion of the treatment epoch is in DSTERM, while the value from controlled terminology is in DSDECOD. Rows 14-16: Show disposition of a subject who completed treatment, but did not complete follow-up. Note that for final disposition event, the date of collection of the event information, DSDTC, was different from the date of the disposition event (the subject's death), DSSTDTC. Rows 19-21: Show disposition of a subject who discontinued the treatment epoch due to an adverse event, but who went on to complete the follow-up phase of the trial.

Example 2 In this example, the sponsor has chosen to simply submit whether or not subjects completed the study, so there is only 1 record per subject. The sponsor did not collect disposition of treatment and did not include DSSCAT. EPOCH was populated as a timing variable, and represents the epoch during which the subject discontinued. Row 1: Subject 456101 completed the study. EPOCH = "FOLLOW-UP", which was the last epoch in the design of this study. Rows 2-3: Subjects 456102 and 456103 discontinued. Both discontinued participation during the treatment epoch.

Example 3 In this study, disposition of study participation was collected for the treatment and follow-up epochs. For these records, the value in EPOCH was taken from the CRF. Data on screen failures were not submitted for this study, so all submitted subjects completed screening; the sponsor chose not to collect data on disposition of the screening epoch. Data on protocol milestones were not collected, but data were collected if a subject's treatment was unblinded. For these records, EPOCH represents the epoch during which the blind was broken. Rows 1, 2: Subject 789101 completed the treatment and follow-up phases. Rows 3, 5: Subject 789102 did not complete the treatment phase but did complete the follow-up phase. Row 4: Subject 789102’s treatment was unblinded. The date of the unblinding is represented in DSSTDTC. Maintaining the blind as per protocol was not considered to be an "event" because there was no change in the subject’s state. ds.xpt

The relationship between the DS record and in the AE record was represented in a RELREC dataset. The DS domain represents the end of the subject's participation in the study, due to their death from heart failure.

The subject's DM record is not shown, but included DTHFL = "Y" and the date of death. Example 5 This below represents a multidrug (isoniazid and levofloxacin) investigational treatment trial for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The protocol allows for a subject to discontinue levofloxacin and continue single treatment of isoniazid throughout the remainder of the study. Disposition of study participation and disposition of each drug was collected. Whether a record with DSCAT = "DISPOSITION EVENT" represents disposition of the subject's participation in the study or disposition of a study treatment is represented in DSSCAT. In this example, disposition of the study and of each drug a subject received for each of the study's 2 treatment epochs. Row 1: Indicates that the physician, per protocol, removed levofloxacin treatment due to high-level positive cultures. This record represents the treatment discontinuation for levofloxacin, for the first treatment epocch.

Example 9 This example is for a study in which multiple informed consents were collected. DSTERM is populated with a full description of the informed consent. DSDECOD is populated with the standardized value "INFORMED CONSENT OBTAINED" from the Protocol Milestone (PROTMLST) codelist. For all informed consent records, DSCAT = "PROTOCOL MILESTONE". The sponsor chose to include the EPOCH timing variable, to indicate the epoch during which each protocol milestone occurred. Row 1: Shows the obtaining of the initial study informed consent. Row 2: Shows randomization, another event with DSCAT = "PROTOCOL MILESTONE". Rows 3-5: Show 3 additional informed consents obtained during the trial. ds.xpt

Example 10 The example represents data for 2 subjects who participated in a study with multiple treatment periods. During the first treatment period, subjects were randomized to drug 1 or drug 2. The second treatment phase added the investigational drug to drug 1 and drug 2. Disposition of study drugs and study participation was collected at the end of each epoch. DSSCAT was used to distinguish between disposition of study drugs vs. study participation. The supporting Demographics (DM), Exposure (EX), Trial Elements (TE), Trial Arms (TA), and Subject Elements (SE) datasets have been provided for additional context. Not all records are shown in the supporting example datasets. The elements used in the TA dataset are defined in the TE dataset. Row 1: Shows the screening element. Rows 2, 3: Show the elements for treatment (either "DRUG1" or "DRUG2"). These appear in the first treatment epoch in the TA dataset. Rows 4, 5: Show the elements for treatment (either "DG1INDG" or "DG2INDG"). These appear in the second treatment epoch in the TA dataset. Row 6: Shows the follow-up element. te.xpt

Example 11 The study in this example had 4 cycles of treatment within the treatment epoch, and each cycle was represented as an element. Although it is not a general requirement that each cycle is represented as a distinct element, doing so was important for this study. The study compared a current standard treatment with drugs A and B to treatment with drugs A, B, and C. The protocol allowed for drug doses to be reduced under specified criteria. For drug C, these dose modifications could include dropping the drug. When drug C is dropped, the subject may transition to treatment with drugs A and B or to follow-up. The TE dataset shows the elements of the trial.

The TA dataset shows the trial design. The sponsor chose to number elements starting with zero for the screening element. For the AB arm, the TAETORD values match the cycle numbers. For the ABC arm, if drug C is dropped, the subject may transition to an AB element or follow-up. TAETORD values are not chronological for this arm such that elements with TAETORD values of "2" or "5" would be during "Cycle 2", elements with TAETORD values of "3" or "6" would be during "Cycle 3", and elements with TAETORD values of "4" or "7" would be during "Cycle 4". ta.xpt

This example shows data for a subject who was randomized to treatment ABC. Drug C was dropped after cycle 2 due to toxicity associated with drug C. Treatment with drugs A and B was stopped after cycle 3 due to disease progression. The subject died during follow-up. The SE dataset records the elements this subject experienced. Rows 1-4: The subject participated in the screening epoch and 3 elements of the treatment epoch.

In this study, disposition of each treatment was collected, and disposition of study participation was collected for each epoch of the trial. The date of disposition for study treatment was defined as the date of the last dose of that treatment. Rows 1-2: Show that informed consent was obtained and randomization occurred during the screening epoch. Row 3: Shows disposition of study participation for the screening epoch. The subject completed this epoch. Row 4: Shows that drug C was ended during the second cycle (TAETORD = "2") of the treatment epoch. Row 5: Shows that drugs A and B were ended on the same day during the third cycle (TAETORD = "6") of the treatment epoch. Row 6: Shows disposition of study participation in the treatment epoch. The subject did not complete treatment, due to disease progression. The date of disposition of the treatment epoch, DSSTDTC, is the date the subject started the follow-up epoch. For this study, that was defined as 4 weeks after the start of the last treatment element. This means that although the subject's last dose of treatment was "2015-04-14", the end of the treatment period was later, on "2015-04-26", when the subject started the follow-up treatment. Row 7: Shows disposition of study participation in the follow-up epoch. The subject died. ds.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. HO – Assumptions
1. The Healthcare Encounters (HO) dataset includes inpatient and outpatient healthcare events (e.g., hospitalizations, nursing home stays, rehabilitation
facility stays, ambulatory surgery).
2. Values of HOTERM typically describe the location or place of the healthcare encounter (e.g., "HOSPITAL" rather than "HOSPITALIZATION").
HOSTDTC should represent the start or admission date and HOENDTC the end or discharge date.
3. Data collected about healthcare encounters may include the reason for the encounter. The following supplemental qualifiers may be appropriate for
representing such data: a. The supplemental qualifier with QNAM = "HOINDC" would be used to represent the indication/medical condition for the encounter (e.g., stroke). Note that --INDC is an Interventions class variable, so is not a standard variable for HO, which is an Events class domain. b. The supplemental qualifier with QNAM = "HOREAS" would be used to represent a reason for the encounter other than a medical condition (e.g., annual checkup).
4. If collected data includes the name of the provider or the facility where the encounter took place, this may be represented using the supplemental
qualifier with QNAM = "HONAM". Note that --NAM is a Findings class variable, so is not a standard variable for HO, which is an Events class domain.
5. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or Events general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the HO domain, but the following Qualifiers
would generally not be used: ‑‑SER, --ACN, --ACNOTH, --REL, --RELNST, --SCAN, --SCONG, --SDISAB, ‑‑SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, -- SMIE, ‑‑BODSYS, ‑‑LOC, ‑‑SEV, --TOX, --TOXGR, --PATT, --CONTRT. HO – Examples Example 1 In this example, a healthcare encounter CRF collects verbatim descriptions of the encounter. Rows 1-2: Subject ABC123101 was hospitalized and then moved to a nursing home. Rows 3-5: Subject ABC123102 was in a hospital in the general ward and then in the intensive care unit. This same subject was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. Rows 6-7: Subject ABC123103 has 2 hospitalization records. Row 8: Subject ABC123104 was seen in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

1. Prior treatments, including prior medications and procedures, should be submitted in an appropriate dataset from the Interventions class (e.g.,
Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) or Procedures (PR)).
2. MH description and coding
a. MHTERM is the topic variable and captures the verbatim term collected for the condition or event or the prespecified term used to collect information about the occurrence of any of a group of conditions or events. MHTERM is a required variable and must have a value. b. MHMODIFY is a permissible variable and should be included if the sponsor’s procedure permits modification of a verbatim term for coding. The modified term is listed in MHMODIFY. The variable should be populated as per the sponsor’s procedures; null values are permitted.

c. If the sponsor codes the reported term (MHTERM) using a standard dictionary, then MHDECOD will be populated with the preferred term derived from the dictionary. The sponsor is expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map the terms utilizing the external codelist element in the Define-XML document. d. MHBODSYS is the system organ class (SOC) from the coding dictionary associated with the adverse event by the sponsor. This value may differ from the primary SOC designated in the coding dictionary's standard hierarchy. e. If a CRF collects medical history by prespecified body systems and the sponsor also codes reported terms using a standard dictionary, then MHDECOD and MHBODSYS are populated using the standard dictionary. MHCAT and MHSCAT should be used for the prespecified body systems.
3. Additional categorization and grouping
a. MHCAT and MHSCAT may be populated with the sponsor's predefined categorization of medical history events, which are often prespecified on the CRF. Note that even if the sponsor uses the body system terminology from the standard dictionary, MHBODSYS and MHCAT may differ; MHBODSYS is derived from the coding system, whereas MHCAT is effectively assigned when the investigator records a condition under the prespecified category. i. This categorization should not group all records (within the MH domain) into one generic group such as “Medical History” or “General Medical History” because this is redundant information with the domain code. If no smaller categorization can be applied, then it is not necessary to include or populate this variable. ii. Examples of MHCAT could include “General Medical History“ (see above assumption; if “General Medical History” is an MHCAT value, then there should be other MHCAT values), “Allergy Medical History, “ and “Reproductive Medical History”. b. MHGRPID may be used to link (or associate) different records together to form a block of related records at the subject level within the MH domain. It should not be used in place of MHCAT or MHSCAT, which are used to group data across subjects. For example, if a group of syndromes reported for a subject were related to a particular disease, then the MHGRPID variable could be populated with the appropriate text.
4. Prespecified terms; presence or absence of events
a. Information on medical history is generally collected in 2 different ways, either by recording free text or using a prespecified list of terms. The solicitation of information on specific medical history events may affect the frequency at which they are reported; therefore, the fact that a specific medical history event was solicited may be of interest to reviewers. MHPRESP and MHOCCUR are used together to indicate whether the condition in MHTERM was prespecified and whether it occurred, respectively. A value of “Y” in MHPRESP indicates that the term was prespecified. b. MHOCCUR is used to indicate whether a prespecified medical condition occurred; a value of "Y" indicates that the event occurred and "N" indicates that it did not. c. If a medical history event was reported using free text, the values of MHPRESP and MHOCCUR should be null. MHPRESP and MHOCCUR are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all medical history events were collected as free text. d. MHSTAT and MHREASND provide information about prespecified medical history questions for which no response was collected. MHSTAT and MHREASND are permissible fields and may be omitted from the dataset if all medications were collected as free text or if all prespecified conditions had responses in MHOCCUR.


## Page 174

e. When medical history events are collected with the recording of free text, a record may be entered into the data management system to indicate “no medical history” for a specific subject or prespecified body system category (e.g., gastrointestinal). For these subjects or categories within subject, do not include a record in the MH dataset to indicate that there were no events.
5. Timing variables
a. Relative timing assessments such as “Ongoing” or "Active" are common in the collection of MH information. MHENRF may be used when this relative timing assessment is coincident with the start of the study reference period for the subject represented in the Demographics (DM) dataset (RFSTDTC). MHENRTPT and MHENTPT may be used when "Ongoing" is relative to another date such as the screening visit date. See the examples in this section and in Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables. b. Additional timing variables (e.g., MHSTRF) may be used when appropriate.
6. MH event date type
a. MHEVDTYP is a domain-specific variable that can be used to indicate the aspect of the event that is represented in the event start and/or end date/times (MHSTDTC and/or MHENDTC). If a start date and/or end date is collected without further specification of what constitutes the start or end of the event, then MHEVDTYP is not needed. However, when data collection specifies how the start or end date is to be reported, MHEVDTYP can be used to provide this information. For example, when collecting the date of diagnosis, it would be used to populate MHSTDTC; MHEVDTYP would be populated with "DIAGNOSIS". If MHEVDTYP is not needed for any collected data, it need not be included in the dataset. If MHEVDTYP is included in the dataset, it should be populated only when the data collection specifies the aspect of the event that is to be used to populate the start and/or end date; otherwise, it should be null. b. When data collected about an event includes 2 different dates that could be considered the start or end of an event, then an MH record will be created for each. For example, if data collection included both a date of onset of symptoms and a date of diagnosis, there would be 2 records for the event, one with MHSTDTC the date of onset of symptoms and MHEVDTYP = "SYMPTOMS" and a second with MHSTDTC the date of diagnosis and MHENDTYP = "DIAGNOSIS". In such a case, it is recommended that the 2 records be linked by means such as a common value of MHSPID or MHGRPID.
7. Any identifiers, timing variables, or Events general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the MH domain, but the following Qualifiers would
generally not be used: --SER, --ACN, --ACNOTH, --REL, --RELNST, --OUT, --SCAN, --SCONG, --SDISAB, ‑‑SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, -- SMIE.

| Situation | Value of | Value of | Value of |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | MHPRESP | MHOCCUR | MHSTAT |
| Spontaneously reported event occurred |  |  |  |
| Pre-specified event occurred | Y | Y |  |
| Pre-specified event did not occur | Y | N |  |
| Pre-specified event has no response | Y |  | NOT DONE |

MH – Examples Example 1 In this example, a General Medical History CRF collected verbatim descriptions of conditions and events by body system (e.g., endocrine, metabolic), did not collect start date, but asked whether or not the condition was ongoing at the time of the visit. Another CRF page was used for cardiac history events. This page asked for date of onset of symptoms and date of diagnosis, but did not include the ongoing question. Rows 1-3: MHCAT indicates that these data were collected on the General Medical History CRF, and MHSCAT indicates the body system for which the event was collected. The reported events were coded using a standard dictionary. MHDECOD and MHBODSYS display the preferred term and body system assigned through the coding process. MHENRTPT was populated based on the response to the "Ongoing" question on the General Medical History CRF. MHENTPT displays the reference date for MHENRTPT, that is, the date the information was collected. If "Yes" was specified for Ongoing, MHENRTPT = "ONGOING"; if "No" was checked, MHENRTPT = "BEFORE". See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables, for further guidance. Rows 4-5: MHCAT indicates that these data were collected on the Cardiac Medical History CRF. Because 2 kinds of start date were collected for congestive heart failure, there are 2 records for this event, with start dates of MHEVDTYP = "SYMPTOM ONSET" and MHEVDTYP = "DIAGNOSIS". The sponsor grouped these 2 records using the MHGRPID value "CHF". mh.xpt

Example 2 In this example, data from 3 CRF modules related to medical history were collected:
• A General Medical History CRF collected descriptions of conditions and events by body system (e.g., endocrine, metabolic) and asked whether the
conditions were ongoing at study start. The reported events were coded using a standard dictionary.
• A second CRF collected stroke history. Terms were selected from a list of terms taken from the standard dictionary.
• A third CRF asked whether the subject had any of a list of 4 specific risk factors.
In all of the records shown below, MHCAT is populated with the CRF module (general medical history, stroke history, or risk factors) through which the data were collected. MHPRESP and MHOCCUR were populated only when the term was prespecified, in keeping with MH assumption 4.

Rows 1-3: Show records from the General Medical History CRF. MHSCAT displays the body systems specified on the CRF. The coded terms are represented in MHDECOD. MHENRF has been populated based on the response to the "Ongoing at Study Start" question on the CRF. If "Yes" was specified, MHENRF = "DURING/AFTER"; if "No" was checked, MHENRF = "BEFORE". See Section 4.4.7, Use of Relative Timing Variables, for further guidance on using --STRF and --ENRF. Row 4: Shows the record from the Stroke History CRF. MHSTDTC was populated with the date and time at which the event occurred. Rows 5-8: Show records from the Risk Factors CRF. MHPRESP values of “Y” indicate that each risk factor was prespecified on the CRF. MHOCCUR is populated with "Y" or "N", corresponding to the CRF response to the questions for the 4 prespecified risk factors. The terms used to describe these risk factors were chosen to have associated codes in the standard dictionary. mh.xpt

Example 3 This is an example of a medical history CRF where the history of specific (prespecified) conditions is solicited. The conditions were not coded using a standard dictionary. The data were collected as part of the screening visit. Rows 1-9: MHPRESP = "Y" indicates that these conditions were specifically queried. Presence or absence of the condition is represented in MHOCCUR. Row 10: There was also a specific question about asthma, as indicated by MHPRESP = "Y", but this question was not asked. Because the question was not asked, MHOCCUR is null and MHSTAT = "NOT DONE". In this case, a reason for the absence of a response was collected, and this is represented in MHREASND. mh.xpt

Example 5 This example shows data from a study in which data were collected about whether subjects had had any respiratory infections in the prior 6 months and, if they had, collected data on those respiratory infections. The example shows data for 2 subjects. Row 1: Shows that subject 203 had no respiratory infections during the evaluation interval (the prior 6 months). The same value ("Respiratory Infections") in both MHTERM and MHCAT indicates that the occurrence question was about a group of medical conditions rather than a specific single medical condition.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. DV – Assumptions
1. The DV domain is an Events model for collected protocol deviations and not for derived protocol deviations that are more likely to be part of analysis.
Events typically include what the event was, captured in --TERM (the topic variable), and when it happened (captured in its start and/or end dates). The intent of the domain model is to capture protocol deviations that occurred during the course of the study (see ICH E3, Section 10.2[1]). Usually these are deviations that occur after the subject has been randomized or received the first treatment.
2. This domain should not be used to collect entry-criteria information. Violated inclusion/exclusion criteria are stored in IE. The Deviations domain is for
more general deviation data. A protocol may indicate that violating an inclusion/exclusion criterion during the course of the study (after first dose) is a protocol violation. In this case, this information would go into DV.
3. Any identifier variables, timing variables, or Events general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the DV domain, but the following qualifiers
would generally not be used: --PRESP, --OCCUR, --STAT, --REASND, --BODSYS, --LOC, --SEV, --SER, --ACN, ‑‑ACNOTH, --REL, --RELNST, -- PATT, --OUT, --SCAN, --SCONG, --SDISAB, --SDTH, --SHOSP, --SLIFE, --SOD, --SMIE, --CONTRT, --TOXGR. DV – Examples Example 1 This is an example of data that was collected on a protocol-deviations CRF. The DVDECOD column is for controlled terminology, whereas the DVTERM is free text. Rows 1, 3: Show examples of a TREATMENT DEVIATION type of protocol deviation. Row 2: Shows an example of a deviation due to the subject taking a prohibited concomitant medication. Row 4: Shows an example of a medication that should not be taken during the study. dv.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. DA – Assumptions
1. This domain records the amount of study product transferred to or from the study subject.
a. Transfers of devices are not represented in this domain, but in the Device Tracking and Disposition (DT) domain. See the SDTMIG for Medical Devices (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/medical-devices-sdtmig/). b. For drugs, transfers are usually recorded using the tests "Dispensed Amount" and "Returned Amount". c. Test terminology for other products may be different; for example, for nutrition, the tests might be "Prepared Amount" and "Unused Amount".
2. DACAT may be used to differentiate transfers of different groups of products (e.g., rescue medications vs. investigational medications).
3. DAREFID and DASPID are both available for capturing label information.
4. The following qualifiers would not generally be used in DA: --MODIFY, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --
STNRC, --NRIND, --RESCAT, --XFN, --NAM, --LOINC, --SPEC, --SPCCND, --METHOD, --BLFL, --FAST, --DRVRL, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.

DA – Examples Example 1 This example shows drug accounting for a study with 2 study medications and one rescue medication, all of which were measured in tablets. The sponsor chose to add EPOCH from the list of timing variables and to use DASPID and DAREFID for code numbers that appeared on the label. da.xpt

Example 2 In this study, drug containers, rather than their contents, were being accounted for and the sponsor did not track returns. In this case, the purpose of the accountability tracking is to verify that the containers dispensed were consistent with the randomization. The sponsor chose to use DASPID to record the identifying number of the container dispensed. da.xpt

6.3.2 Death Details (DD)
DD – Description/Overview A findings domain that contains the diagnosis of the cause of death for a subject. The domain is designed to hold supplemental data that are typically collected when a death occurs, such as the official cause of death. It does not replace existing data such as serious adverse event details in AE. Further, it does not introduce a new requirement to collect information that is not already indicated as good clinical practice or defined in regulatory guidelines. Instead, it provides a consistent place within the SDTM to hold information that previously did not have a clearly defined home. DD – Specification dd.xpt, Death Details — Findings. One record per finding per subject, Tabulation.

DD – Assumptions
1. There may be more than 1 cause of death. If so, these may be separated into primary and secondary causes and/or other appropriate designations. DD
may also include other details about the death, such as where the death occurred and whether it was witnessed.
2. Death details are typically collected on designated CRF pages. The DD domain is not intended to collate data that are collected in standard variables in
other domains, such as AE.AEOUT (Outcome of Adverse Event), AE.AESDTH (Results in Death) or DS.DSTERM (Reported Term for the Disposition Event). Data from other domains that relates to the death can be linked to DD using RELREC.
3. This domain is not intended to include data obtained from autopsy. An autopsy is a procedure from which there will usually be findings. Autopsy
information should be handled as per recommendations in the Procedures (PR) domain.
4. There are separate codelists for DD tests and responses. Associations between the DD tests and response codelists are described in the DD codetable
(available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology).
5. Any identifiers, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the DD domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --MODIFY, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --NAM, --LOINC, -- SPEC, --SPCCND, --LOBXFL, --BLFL, --FAST, --DRVFL, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV. DD – Examples Example 1 This example shows the primary cause of death for 3 subjects. The CRF also collected the location of the subject’s death and a secondary cause of death. Rows 1-2: Show the primary cause of death and location of death for a subject. DDDTC is the date of assessment. Rows 3-4: Show records for primary cause of death and location of death for another subject for whom the information was not known. Rows 5-7: Show primary and secondary cause of death and location of death for a third subject. dd.xpt

Example 2 This example illustrates how the DD, Disposition (DS), and AE data for a subject were linked using RELREC. Note that each of these domains serves a different purpose, even though the information is related. This subject had a fatal adverse event, represented in the AE domain. ae.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID AESEQ AETERM AESTDTC AEENDTC AEDECOD AEBODSYS AEOUT AESER AESDTH

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. EG – Assumptions
1. EGREFID is intended to store an identifier (e.g., UUID) for the associated ECG tracing. EGXFN is intended to store the name of and path to the
electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform file when it is submitted.
2. There are separate codelists for tests and results based on regular 10-second ECGs and for tests and results based on Holter monitoring.
a. Associations between some ECG abnormality tests and response codelists are described in the ECG codetable (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology).
3. For non-individual ECG beat data and for aggregate ECG parameter results (e.g., "QT interval", "RR", "PR", "QRS"), EGREFID is populated for all
unique ECGs, so that submitted SDTM data can be matched to the actual ECGs stored in the ECG warehouse. Therefore, this variable is expected for these types of records.
4. For individual-beat parameter results, waveform data will not be stored in the warehouse, so there will be no associated identifier for these beats.
5. The method for QT interval correction is specified in the test name by controlled terminology: EGTESTCD = "QTCFAG" and EGTEST = "QTcF
Interval, Aggregate" is used for Fridericia's formula; EGTESTCD = "QTCBAG" and EGTEST = "QTcB Interval, Aggregate", is used for Bazett's formula.
6. EGBEATNO is used to differentiate between beats in beat-to-beat records.
7. EGREPNUM is used to differentiate between multiple repetitions of a test within a given time frame.
8. EGNRIND can be added to indicate where a result falls with respect to reference range defined by EGORNRLO and EGORNRHI. Examples: "HIGH",
"LOW". Clinical significance would be represented as described in Section 4.5.5, Clinical Significance for Findings Observation Class Data, in EGCLSIG (see also EG Example 1).
9. When "QTcF Interval, Aggregate" or "QTcB Interval, Aggregate" is derived by the sponsor, the derived flag (EGDRVFL) is set to "Y". However, when
the "QTcF Interval, Aggregate" or "QTcB Interval, Aggregate" is received from a central provider or vendor, the value would go into EGORRES and EGDRVFL would be null (see Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for Variables).
10. If this domain is used in conjunction with the ECG QT Correction Model Data (QT) domain:
a. For each QT correction method used in the study, values of EGTESTCD and EGTEST are assigned at the study level.

|  |  |  |  |  | (EGTPTREF). Not a clock time or a date time variable. Represented as an ISO 8601 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | duration. Examples: "-PT15M" to represent the period of 15 minutes prior to the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | reference point indicated by EGTPTREF, "PT8H" to represent the period of 8 hours |  |

b. The sponsor should assign values for EGTESTCD/EGTEST appropriately with clear documentation on what each test code represents. For example, if the protocol calls for computing the top two best fit models, the sponsor could choose to name the top best fit model QTCIAG1 and the second best fit model QTCIAG2, in rank order.
11. Any identifiers, timing variables, or findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the EG domain, but the following qualifiers would not
generally be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --SPEC, --SPCCND, --FAST, --SEV. It is recommended that ‑‑LOINC not be used. EG - Examples Example 1 This example shows ECG measurements and other findings from one ECG for one subject. EGCAT has been used to group tests. Row 1: Shows a measurement of ventricular rate. This result was assessed as not clinically significant (EGCLSIG = "N"). Row 2: Shows a measurement of PR interval. This result was assessed as clinically significant (EGCLSIG = "Y"). Rows 2-4: These interval measurements were collected in seconds. However, in this submission, the standard unit for these tests was milliseconds, so the results have been converted in EGSTRESC and EGSTRESN. Rows 5-6: Show "QTcB Interval, Aggregate" and "QTcF Interval, Aggregate". These results were derived by the sponsor, as indicated by the “Y” in the EGDRVFL column. Note that EGORRES is null for these derived records. Rows 7-10: Show results from tests looking for certain kinds of abnormalities, which have been grouped using EGCAT = "FINDINGS". Row 11: Shows a technical problem represented as the result of the test "Technical Quality". Results of this test can be important to the overall understanding of an ECG, but are not truly findings or interpretations about the subject's heart function. Row 12: Shows the result of the TEST "Interpretation" (i.e., the interpretation of the ECG strip as a whole), which for this ECG was "ABNORMAL".

Example 2 This example shows ECG results where only the overall assessment was collected. Results are for one subject across multiple visits. In addition, the ECG interpretation was provided by the investigator and, when necessary, by a cardiologist. EGGRPID is used to group the overall assessments collected on each ECG. Rows 1-3: Show interpretations performed by the principal investigation on three different occasions. The ECG at Visit "SCREEN 2" has been flagged as the last observation before start of study treatment. Rows 4-5: Show interpretations of the same ECG by both the investigator and a cardiologist. EGGRPID has been used to group these two records to emphasize their relationship. eg.xpt

Example 3 This example shows 10-second ECG replicates extracted from a continuous recording. The example shows one subject’s extracted 10-second ECG replicate results. Three replicates were extracted for planned time points "1 HR" and "2 HR"; EGREPNUM is used to identify the replicates. Summary mean measurements are reported for the 10 seconds of extracted data for each replicate. EGDTC is the date/time of the first individual beat in the extracted 10-second ECG. In order to save space, some permissible variables (EGREFID, VISITDY, EGTPTNUM, EGTPTREF, EGRFTDTC) have been omitted, as marked by ellipses. eg.xpt

Example 4 The example shows one subject’s continuous beat-to-beat EG results. Only 3 beats are shown, but there could be measurements for, as an example, 101,000 complexes in 24 hours. The actual number of complexes in
24 hours can be variable and depends on average heart rate. The results are mapped to the EG domain using EGBEATNO. If there is no result to be reported, then the row would not be included.
Rows 1-2: Show the first beat recorded. The first beat was considered to be the beat for which the recording contained a complete P-wave. It was assigned EGBEATNO = "1". There is no RR measurement for this beat because RR is measured as the duration (time) between the peak of the R-wave in the reported single beat and peak of the R-wave in the preceding single beat, and the partial recording that preceded EGBEATNO = "1" did not contain an R-wave. EGDTC was the date/time of the individual beat. Rows 3-5: EGBEATNO = "2" had an RR measurement, since the R-wave of the preceding beat (EGBEATNO = "1") was recorded. Rows 6-8: There is a 1-hour gap between beats 2 and 3 due to electrical interference or other artifacts that prevented measurements from being recorded. Note that EGBEATNO = "3" does have an RR measurement because the partial beat preceding EGBEATNO = "3" contained an R-wave.

IE – Assumptions
1. The intent of the IE domain model is to collect responses to only those criteria that the subject did not meet, and not the responses to all criteria. For the
complete list of inclusion/exclusion criteria, see Section 7.4.1, Trial Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.
2. This domain should be used to document the exceptions to inclusion or exclusion criteria at the time that eligibility for study entry is determined (e.g., at
the end of a run-in period or immediately before randomization). This domain should not be used to collect protocol deviations/violations incurred during the course of the study, typically after randomization or start of study medication. See Section 6.2.7, Protocol Deviations, for the model that is used to submit protocol deviations/violations.
3. IETEST is to be used only for the verbatim description of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. If the text is no more than 200 characters, it goes in
IETEST; if the text is more than 200 characters, put meaningful text in IETEST and describe the full text in the study metadata. See Section 4.5.3.1, Test Name (--TEST) Greater than 40 Characters, for further information.
4. The following qualifiers would generally not be used in IE: --MODIFY, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORRESU, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STRESN, --
STRESU, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --RESCAT, --XFN, --NAM, --LOINC, --SPEC, --SPCCND, --LOC, --METHOD, --BLFL, -- LOBXFL, --FAST, --DRVFL, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV, --STAT. IE – Examples Example 1 This example shows records for 3 subjects who failed to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria but who were included in the study. Rows 1-2: Show data for a subject with 2 inclusion/exclusion exceptions. Rows 3-4: Show data for 2 other subjects, both of whom failed the same inclusion criterion. ie.xpt

6.3.5 Specimen-based Findings Domains
Individual domains (e.g., IS, LB, MB) for laboratory measurements, tests, or examinations performed on collected biological specimens (e.g., blood, urine, tumor tissue) are grouped together in this section. This grouping is not meant to imply that there is a single laboratory domain for all test methodologies. Additional laboratory domains are expected to be added in future versions.
6.3.5.1 Generic Specimen-based Lab Findings Domain Specification
This section describes variables commonly used in specimen-based laboratory domains (e.g., IS, LB, MB/MS, MI, PC/PP).

• The SDTMIG includes several domains for representing clinical pathology laboratory measurements, tests, and examinations supporting safety and/or
efficacy analyses. Each domain is defined to group measures of a common topic (e.g., microbiology susceptibility, microscopic findings, pharmacokinetic concentrations).
• In the generic lab domain specification table that follows, "--" is used as a placeholder. In each individual laboratory findings domain specification, it is
replaced by the appropriate domain code.
• The variables in the generic domain specification table include required, expected, and permissible variables typically used across specimen-based
laboratory findings domains to uniquely describe a measurement, test, or examination of a biological specimen.
o Individual domains include additional variables with specific Controlled Terminology codelists and domain-specific Core values.
o The Findings general observation class includes additional permissible variables that may be added when representing specimen-based laboratory
findings.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. BS – Assumptions
1. The BS domain is used to store findings related to specimen handling and specimen characteristics such as type, amount, or size. BS is not restricted to
PGx-related specimens.
2. For biospecimens of genetic material, BSSPEC values are drawn from the GENSMP (C111114) codelist.
3. Non-genetic BSSPEC values are drawn from the SPEC (C77529) codelist, which is part the SEND terminology listing. BSANTREG is used to further
define BSSPEC when it is desirable to identify a specific region within an organ.
4. To adapt BS for use with the SDTMIG, use the SPECTYPE (C78734) codelist in BSSPEC, add --LOC, --LAT, --DIR, and --PORTOT as applicable,
and remove BSANTREG. Values that would otherwise have gone in BSANTREG may be placed in a supplemental qualifier that is almost identical to that variable, but which further qualifies BSLOC instead of BSSPEC.
5. The following variables generally would not be used in BS: --POS, --ORNLO, --ORNHI, --STRNLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --LEAD, --
CSTATE, --ACPTFL, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV, --DTHREL. BS – Example Example 1 This example shows data about RNA integrity. The data collected focus on the quality of the RNA sample being collected. It has been shown that improper storage or isolation methods might compromise the usability of a sample. Rows 1-2: The A260/A280 and A260/A230 rations are used to determine the purity of the RNA sample. Any ratios outside of the accepted values may indicated contamination with protein or reagents used during the extraction process. Row 3: The amounts of both 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA are measured and then a ratio is calculated. Because values in --TESTCD cannot begin with a number, the test code has been prefixed with an "I" for integrity. Row 4: The RNA integrity number is a quality measurement calculated using a special algorithm and used to determine the usability of the RNA sample.

6.3.5.3 Cell Phenotype Findings (CP)
CP – Description/Overview A findings domain that contains data related to the characterization of cell phenotype, lineage, and function based on expression of specific markers in single cell or particle suspensions. The CP domain is modeled for use with disseminated tissue specimens (e.g., blood and other body fluids, bone marrow aspirates) and cell suspensions, and is not currently modeled for evaluations of solid tissue specimens. The domain is intended to support tests associated with a cell phenotyping component based on the use of markers and is not intended for tests that are not associated with marker-based phenotyping, which are more appropriate to include in another domain (e.g., Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments (IS), Laboratory Test Results (LB), Microscopic Findings (MI)). The CP domain is not intended to supplant use of the LB domain for routine lab hematology (e.g., blood cell differentials), nor is it intended for findings originating from microscopic assessment of cells, including those employing immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. The modeled use cases include measurement of
• cell populations identified, classified, and/or otherwise characterized based on the differential expression of phenotypic and/or cell state/function markers, as determined for both normal and abnormal cell
populations;
• the level of marker expression;
• substances interacting with (e.g., binding to) a marker which is a target of interest (not limited to a pharmacologic target); and
• other cell properties based on characterization of expression marker(s) and/or substances that interact with the marker(s).
To provide the flexibility needed to report cell marker expression data, which can range widely in complexity, several new SDTM variables have been created. Most of the new variables are permissible, and are available as needed to fully define a test and/or to prevent ambiguity that could lead to misunderstanding or difficulty in interpreting the data. New variables include --SBMRKS (Sublineage Marker String), -- CELSTA (Cell State), --CSMRKS (Cell State Marker String), --TSTCND (Test Condition), --CNDAGT (Test Condition Agent), --BNDAGT (Binding Agent), --ABCLID (Antibody Clone Identifier), --MRKSTR (Marker String), --GATE (Gate Name), --GATEDEF (Gate Definition), --SPTSTD (Sponsor Test Description), --TSTPNL (Test Panel), --RESSCL (Result Scale), and --RESTYP (Result Type). Definitions and appropriate use of these variables are provided in the Specification and Assumptions sections of this guidance and are illustrated in the examples for selected use cases. Data submitters should work closely with laboratory data providers, analysts, and data receivers/users to determine the appropriate set of permissible variables to include in a dataset (i.e., the variables needed to fully document tests and associated findings for a particular use case).

Sponsors that previously chose to submit cell phenotyping data in the LB domain, where LBTEST was often used to populate cell marker information (e.g., "CD4" to indicate helper T lymphocytes), should note that the new variable --MRKSTR should be used to house the full marker string information used to define the test in terms of markers; the --TEST variable is reserved for the name of the cell population. Several of the new variables (i.e., --SBMRKS, --CELSTA, -- CSMRKS) are used to further subdivide the population reported in --TEST into more granular unnamed subpopulations based on 1 or more additional markers. This approach provides a more easily understood test name in the --TEST variable and enables development of controlled terminology for --TEST and -- TESTCD. The goal is to standardize, where possible, cell phenotype test names across studies so that it will be easier for users to understand and interpret the data (e.g., when different marker sets are used across labs to define the same cell population). This approach also enhances the ability to integrate and compare data across studies in a practicable manner that (in addition to being less error-prone) preserves the often subtle differences between tests, which are essential for determining whether tests are truly comparable. Used in accordance with this guidance, the complete marker sting information provided in the --MRKSTR variable reflects the operational (i.e., laboratoryspecific) definition of the test measurement. Together with the gating information provided in the --GATE and --GATEDEF variables, --MRKSTR values help to ensure that proper groupings and comparisons are made across tests by preserving nuanced details that may affect the interpretation of test results. To facilitate these objectives and to enable accurate cross-study comparisons and data-mining efforts, it is recommended that --MRKSTR values conform as closely as possible to marker string formatting principles presented in the CP Assumptions section.

|  |  |  |  |  | column name when converting a dataset from a vertical to a horizontal format. The value in CPTESTCD |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | cannot be longer than 8 characters, nor can it start with a number (e.g., "1TEST" is not valid). |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPTESTCD cannot contain characters other than letters, numbers, or underscores. Examples: |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | "MONO", "MNS". |  |
| CPTEST | Name of Measurement,<br>Test or Examination | Char | (CPTEST) | Synonym<br>Qualifier | Long name for CPTESTCD. For cell phenotyping, the name (often abbreviated) of the cell population, | Req |
|  |  |  |  |  | as it is generally accepted by the scientific community, is populated (rather than a colloquial designation |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | based on a primary marker, e.g., TLym Help rather than CD4). When the test is for a sublineage which |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | can only be identified by specifying additional markers (i.e., has not been given a name) or which is |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | further restricted to a subpopulation based on a particular cell state (e.g., activated, proliferating, |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | apoptotic), the Sublineage Marker String (CPSBMRKS), Cell State (CPCELSTA), and Cell State Marker |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | String (CPCSMRKS) variables are additionally populated and the value in CPTEST is suffixed with |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | "Sub" to denote that it is a subset of the population identified in CPTEST (e.g., Monocytes Sub). |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | The value in CPTEST cannot be longer than 40 characters. |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPSBMRKS | Sublineage Marker<br>String | Char |  | Variable<br>Qualifier | Used to further subset the cell population identified in CPTEST based on the use of additional marker(s) | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | that define a sublineage. The value in CPSBMRKS is used in combination with values in CPTEST and |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPCELSTA to fully describe the cell population being measured. As such, it is an essential component |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | of the full test name. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | For example, three unnamed sublineages of monocytes have been identified as: CCR2+CD16-, CCR2- |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CD16+, and CCR2+CD16+. Whereas the entire monocyte cell population can be defined as CD14+ |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | cells, the additional CCR2 and CD16 markers are used to differentiate one sublineage from another. As |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | none of these sublineages have been given names, they are only known by the CCR2 and CD16 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | marker combinations. By associating the CPTEST value of "Monocytes Sub" with, for example, a value |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | of "CCR2+CD16-" in CPSBMRKS, the full test is defined to be the CCR2+CD16- monocyte |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | subpopulation. |  |
| CPCELSTA | Cell State | Char | (CELSTATE) | Variable<br>Qualifier | A textual description of a subset of the cell population identified in CPTEST based on a particular | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | functional and/or biological state (e.g., "ACTIVATED", "PROLIFERATING", "SENESCENT"). When |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | populated, the values in CPCELSTA and CPSMRKS, in combination with the values in CPTEST and |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPSBMRKS, fully describe the cell population being measured. |  |
| CPCSMRKS | Cell State Marker String | Char |  | Variable<br>Qualifier | Identifies the marker(s) or indicator(s) used to define the cell state (i.e., the value in CPCELSTA). | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | For example, when Ki67 expression is used to determine that a cell population is in a proliferating state |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | (i.e., CPCELSTA value="PROLIFERATING"), the value "Ki67+" in CPCSMRKS indicates that positive |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | expression of Ki67 was used to define the population as proliferating. Similarly, a value of "Ki67-" in |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPCSMRKS would indicate that lack of expression of Ki67 defined the "NON-PROLIFERATING" cell |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | state in CPCELSTA. The CPCSMRKS value is useful for quickly determining which marker(s) were |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | used to classify (i.e., operationally define) a cell population based on a functional/biological state. |  |
| CPTSTCND | Test Condition | Char | (TESTCOND) | Variable<br>Qualifier | Identifies any planned condition imposed by the assay system on the specimen at the time the test is | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | performed. --TSTCND is generally used to distinguish between two or more records where the same |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | assay is performed under varying (as opposed to fixed) conditions, usually for the purpose of making a |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | comparison. For example, when the same assay (identified in --TEST) is performed under stimulated |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | and non-stimulated conditions, the --TSTCND variable is used distinguish between the records. |  |
| CPCNDAGT | Test Condition Agent | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The textual description of the agent, if applicable, used to impose the condition identified in | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPTSTCND. For example, records might be produced for the same assay run under stimulating |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | (CPTSTCND value = "STIMULATED") conditions produced by different stimulating agents (e.g., phorbol |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | myristate acetate, concanavalin A, PHA-P, TNF-alpha, Ionomycin, candida antigen). |  |
| CPBDAGNT | Binding Agent | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The textual description of the agent that is binding to the entity in the CPTEST variable. The | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPBDAGNT variable is used to indicate that there is a binding relationship between the entities in the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPTEST and CPBDAGNT variables, regardless of direction. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | The binding agent may be, but is not limited to, a test article; a portion of a test article; a substance |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | related to a test article; an endogenous molecule; an allergen; an infectious agent; or a reagent (e.g., |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | primary antibody) that confers the binding specificity for the measurement defined in CPTEST when it is |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | needed to uniquely identify the test. |  |
| CPABCLID | Antibody Clone Identifier | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | Identifies the antibody clone (e.g., supplier-provided catalog name) used to confer specificity for the | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | binding agent specified in CPBDAGNT. |  |
| CPMRKSTR | Marker String | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The text string identifying the full set of markers/indicators used by the laboratory to operationally define | Exp |
|  |  |  |  |  | the complete test based on the combination of CPTEST, CPSBMRKS, and CPCELSTA. Because |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | laboratories often use different markers/indicators to identify a cell population, the relationship between |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | a named cell population in CPTEST (as combined with CPSBMRKS and CPCELSTA values) and the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | set of markers used to identify that population is many-to-one. To ensure nuances important for |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | accurately interpreting the data are accounted for and which arise from the use of different sets of |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | markers, it is necessary to operationally define the test in terms of the complete set of |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | markers/indicators used to perform that test. |  |
| CPGATE | Gate | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The sponsor-defined name assigned to a gate. Gates are electronic (i.e., a device setting or software- | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | defined) boundaries set by a user to virtually parse a specimen into discrete populations based on a set |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  | of defined characteristics (e.g., presence, absence, or intensity of expression of various markers; |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | physical size; internal complexity or granularity). Gates are used to constrain data collection or analysis |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | to a specific cell population or region of interest within the specimen. |  |
| CPGATDEF | Gate Definition | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The text string identifying the set of parameters and the order in which they are applied to define the | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | gating strategy. In practice, a series of 2-dimensional sub-gates based on different cell characteristics |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | (i.e., markers/indicators/physical properties) are most often combined until the cell population of interest |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | is sufficiently resolved (i.e., electronically isolated) from other cell populations contained within the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | specimen. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | For complex analyses, differences in gating strategies can produce subtle differences in results |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | obtained for a test. To ensure nuances important for accurately interpreting the data are accounted for |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | and which arise from the use of different gating strategies, it is often necessary to qualify the test in |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | terms of the gating strategy. For some purposes, however, and at the discretion of the sponsor, only the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | ultimate or penultimate gate is identified. When specifying the gating strategy in CPGATDEF, each sub- |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | gate should be listed in the order it was applied and separated from the next sub-gate using the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | pipe/vertical line ("\\|") character. |  |
| CPSPTSTD | Sponsor Test<br>Description | Char |  | Record<br>Qualifier | Sponsor's description of a test. The variable is intended to contain highly structured test description | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | metadata used by a sponsor to unambiguously define (label) a test. Such values generally reside in a |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | sponsor/laboratory test metadata repository. CPSPTSTD is not intended for unstructured (spontaneous) |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | free text. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | An example of appropriate usage is when it is necessary to include identifying information for a target |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | cell population on which a test is conducted when the target population is not part of the test name, e.g., |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | tests for quantitative expression of a particular marker on a specific cell population. |  |
| CPCAT | Category | Char | (CPCAT) | Grouping<br>Qualifier | Used to define a category of topic-variable values across subjects. Examples: | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | "IMMUNOPHENOTYPING", "CELL FUNCTION", "TARGET ENGAGEMENT". |  |
| CPSCAT | Subcategory | Char |  | Grouping<br>Qualifier | A further categorization of CPCAT. | Perm |
| CPTSTPNL | Test Panel | Char |  | Grouping<br>Qualifier | Sponsor-defined textual description used to group tests run together as part of a test panel. Can be | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | used with --GRPID to ensure that relationships between associated tests are accurately identified. |  |
| CPORRES | Result or Finding in<br>Original Units | Char |  | Result<br>Qualifier | Result of the measurement or finding as originally received or collected. | Exp |
| CPORRESU | Original Units | Char | (UNIT) | Variable<br>Qualifier | Original units in which the data were collected. The unit for CPORRES. Examples: "10^6/L", "%", | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | "MESF". |  |
| CPRESSCL | Result Scale | Char | (RSLSCLRS) | Record<br>Qualifier | Classifies the scale of the original result value with respect to whether the result is quantitative, ordinal, | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | nominal, or narrative. |  |
| CPRESTYP | Result Type | Char | (RESTYPRS) | Record<br>Qualifier | Classifies the kind of result (i.e., property type) originally reported for the test. Examples: "NUMBER | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CONCENTRATION", "NUMBER FRACTION", "RATIO". |  |
| CPCOLSRT | Collected Summary<br>Result Type | Char | (COLSTYP) | Record<br>Qualifier | Used to indicate the type of collected summary result. This includes source summary results collected | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | on a CRF or provided by an external vendor (e.g., central lab). If the summary result is derived using |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | individual source data records, this summary result should be represented in ADaM. If a sponsor has |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | both a collected summary result and a derived summary result, the collected summary result should be |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | represented in SDTM and the derived summary result should be represented in ADaM. |  |
| CPORNRLO | Reference Range Lower<br>Limit in Orig Unit | Char |  | Variable<br>Qualifier | Lower end of reference range for continuous measurement in original units. Should be populated only | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | for continuous results. |  |
| CPORNRHI | Reference Range Upper<br>Limit in Orig Unit | Char |  | Variable<br>Qualifier | Upper end of reference range for continuous measurement in original units. Should be populated only | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | for continuous results. |  |
| CPSTRESC | Result or Finding in<br>Standard Format | Char |  | Result<br>Qualifier | Contains the result value for all findings, copied or derived from CPORRES in a standard format or in | Exp |
|  |  |  |  |  | standard units. CPSTRESC should store all results or findings in character format; if results are |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | numeric, they should also be stored in numeric format in CPSTRESN. |  |
| CPSTRESN | Numeric Result/Finding<br>in Standard Units | Num |  | Result<br>Qualifier | Used for continuous or numeric results or findings in standard format; copied in numeric format from | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | CPSTRESC. CPSTRESN should store all numeric test results or findings. |  |

CP – Assumptions
1. The Cell Phenotype domain captures cell phenotyping and related data based on cell expression markers
and other indicators (e.g., stains/dyes) in disseminated tissue specimens and cell suspensions.
2. The CP domain is only used for tests which include a phenotyping component that relies on using cell
markers to identify a specific population of cells (e.g., quantitative cell phenotyping), or on which the test is conducted (e.g., quantitative single marker expression, target/receptor occupancy). For example, a test which measures gamma-interferon expression in helper T lymphocytes defined as the CD45+CD3+CD4+CD8- population is an appropriate test for including in CP, whereas a test which measures gamma interferon secretion in an undefined "PBMC" (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) population is not appropriate.
3. A value which is calculated and reported by a lab according to its procedures is considered collected rather
than derived; the Derived Flag (CPDRVFL) should be null for these results.
4. CPCELSTA is used in conjunction with CPSCMRKS. When CPCELSTA is populated, CPSCMRKS must
also be populated. Conversely, when CPSCMRKS is populated, CPCELSTA must be populated.
5. The combination of values in CPTEST, CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, and CPCSMRKS are used to uniquely
identify a test. When 1 or more of the variables CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, or CPCSMRKS are populated, the Test Name (CPTEST) must be populated with the test name variant containing the "Sub" suffix to indicate that the finding/result pertains to a subpopulation of the cell type named in CPTEST.
6. Populating the CPTEST and CPMRKSTR variables: The general structure of CPTEST depends on the use
case (e.g., immunophenotyping, quantitative marker expression, target/receptor occupancy), which is generally conveyed by the CPCAT and/or CPSCAT value(s). Currently, CP supports the following use cases for which guidance on CPTEST and CPMRKSTR values are given: a. Immunophenotyping i. CPTEST is populated with the name of the cell type being measured, not with the set of markers used to define the cell type. ii. It is expected that CPMRKSTR is populated, and that it contains the entire set of markers used to define the test, including those that are also present in CPSBMRKS and/or CPCSMRKS. iii. Marker strings follow, as closely as possible, formatting recommendations presented in assumption 8. b. Quantitative single-marker expression i. CPTEST begins with the identity of the marker (e.g., CD99), followed by the word "Expression" (e.g., "CD99 Expression"). ii. It is expected that CPMRKSTR is populated, and that it starts by identifying the marker being quantified (e.g. "CD99"). This is followed by a delimiter (described below) and then the entire marker string used to define the cell population on which the marker is measured, including the marker being quantified, since it also defines the cell population. iii. The general form of the delimiter used to separate the marker being quantified from the cell population on which it is measured is "<space>xxxx<space>", where "xxxx" represents a character string used as delimiting text. It is recommended that the delimiting text is the abbreviation for the unit of measure used to report the level of expression of the quantified marker (e.g., "MESF", "MdFI"). An example which follows this guidance is: CPTEST = "CD99 Expression" and CPMRKSTR = "CD99 MESF CD45+CD3-CD19+CD99+", where "MESF" is the text delimiter and is followed by the entire marker string defining the cell population on which CD99 was measured, which includes the CD99 marker itself. iv. Marker strings follow, as closely as possible, formatting recommendations presented in assumption 8. c. Other use cases (e.g., target/receptor occupancy), refer to the examples section and to published Controlled Terminology supporting CP. In the case of target/receptor occupancy a more generalized test value is populated into CPTEST (e.g., "Total Bound") and the identity of the target/receptor is

included in another variable, such as CPBNDAGT and/or CPTSTPNL (refer to examples). CDISC will continue to develop examples for other use cases as they are identified and modeled.
7. Specifying viability:
a. Because the majority of cell phenotyping tests of interest are for viable cells, the word "Viable" is not generally included in the test name (CPTEST) and usually does not need to be explicitly stated in CPCELSTA. Because populating CPCELSTA and CSMRKS with viability information necessitates appending the "Sub" suffix to the value in CPTEST (assumption 5), it is recommended that CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS generally not be used unless a selective viability stain was included in the test in order to differentiate the record for viable cells from record(s) for cells in a different vital state. For example, when viable cells are being compared to apoptotic and/or non-viable cells, it is necessary to differentiate those records using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS. In such cases where CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS are populated, the "Sub" suffix is appended to the value in CPTEST (assumption 5). b. Viability marker(s) used to define a test are included in the full marker string in CPMRKSTR regardless of whether the viability status is stated explicitly in CPCELSTA. Moreover, if viability is explicitly stated in CPGATE, marker(s) used to designate viability are included in CPGATDEF. For example, if the value in CPGATE is "Lymphocytes, Viable" and 7AAD- was used to define the viable state, 7AAD- is included in CPGATDEF, in addition to being included in the complete marker string in CPMRKSTR.
8. Recommended formatting of marker string variables CPMRKSTR, CPSBMRKS, and CPCSMRKS: The
marker string variables provide critical information for defining a test. Although there are no current plans to control their values through CDISC Controlled Terminology codelists, adherence to the following formatting guidelines helps to preclude ambiguities that can lead to uncertainty in uniquely understanding a test and its associated result. a. Marker strings do not contain delimiting characters (e.g., ",", space, "/", "|") to separate individual markers within the string, nor do they contain punctuation (e.g., hyphens) within individual markers, as these can be confused with symbols used to designate levels of expression and/or make it difficult to distinguish between the individual markers that comprise the string. For example, although the scientific literature often uses "HLA-DR", this is represented in CP marker strings as "HLADR". b. Forward slash "/" is only used to separate the portion of the marker string defining a numerator from the portion defining a denominator. c. When referring to a marker using the cluster of differentiation (CD) designation, "CD" should be included as part of the marker reference. For example, a marker string for helper T lymphocytes comprising CD45, CD3, CD4, and CD8 markers would be "CD45+CD3+CD4+CD8-" (rather than "45+3+4+8-"). d. The order of markers within a string is consistent across similar tests, generally proceeding in the order that defines the cell hierarchy from highest to lowest, followed by additional non-lineage-defining markers, and ending with cell state and viability markers. This order maintains alignment with how a test is identified using the ordered combination of CPTEST, CPSMRKS, and CPCELSTA. For example, a test for proliferating viable activated central memory helper T-lymphocytes would be operationally defined in CPMRKSTR as similar to "CD45+CD3+CD19-CD4+CD8-CD197+CD45RA- CD278+Ki67+7AAD-", where the order of markers in the string is "CD45" (leukocyte), "CD3+CD19- (T lymphocyte), "CD4+CD8-" (helper), "CD197+CD45RA-" (central memory), "CD278+ (activated), Ki67+ (proliferating), 7AAD- (viable). Corresponding to this marker-based definition of the test, and using the appropriate Controlled Terminology terms, CPTEST is "TLym Help Cen Mem Sub", CPCELSTA is "ACTIVATED; PROLIFERATING", and CPCSMRKS is "CD278+Ki67+". If the sponsor also chose to include the viability status as a cell state in addition to the activation and proliferative states, CPCELSTA would be similar to "ACTIVATED; PROLIFERATING; VIABLE" and the corresponding CPCSMRKS value would be "CD278+Ki67+7AAD-". In this example, the named cell population in CPTEST has not been further divided into an unnamed sublineage based on additional sublineage markers; therefore, CPSBMRKS is null.

e. Forward (FSC) and Side (SSC) light scatter: These parameters are generally used to perform initial gating to exclude debris non-singlets and are often reapplied to differentiate cell subpopulations in the "inclusion" gate. However, FSC and SSC are often not included in marker string definitions as it is generally taken for granted that they were used. In contrast, they are usually included in a descriptions of a gating strategy, and would generally be included in CPGATDEF when the full gating strategy is shown. Labs/sponsors may choose whether to include FSC and SSC parameters in CPMRKSTR. It is recommended to include them when they are needed to differentiate one test from another. For example, because there is no universal expression marker specific for lymphocytes, FSC and SSC are used to define the lymphocyte subpopulation within a CD45+ leukocyte population. A test of "Lymphocytes/Leukocytes" defined only in terms of CD45 expression would not make sense as it would be "CD45+/CD45+". In this case, it makes sense to define lymphocytes as "CD45+SSClo" so that the value in CPMRKSTR is "CD45+SSClo/CD45+". f. Indicating the expression level of individual markers included in a marker string: A variety of formats are used in the scientific literature for indicating the level of expression of a marker on or within a cell. For example, after identifying a marker such as CD4, its level of expression might be represented as 1 of the following: i. neg, min, or - to denote the absence or minimal expression (e.g., CD4neg, CD4min, CD4-) ii. pos or + to denote that the marker is expressed (e.g., CD4pos, CD4+) iii. high, hi, or ++ to denote that the marker is expressed at a very high level relative to simply being "positive" (e.g., CD4high, CD4hi, CD4++) iv. other formats (e.g., -/low, -/lo, low, lo, mid, -/+, +++) g. Because categories for expression levels are subjective in the sense that they are relative to one another, various formats often overlap, which can create ambiguities. Some degree of consistency in formats used to represent relative expression levels is warranted to mitigate ambiguity, at least to the extent that relative expression levels used to define cell lineages/sublineages are similar across studies and laboratories in order to enable comparisons. Five designations are recommended for use in SDTM datasets: i. "-" (the marker is not expressed; at times, the use of "-lo" may be justified to indicate that the marker is either not expressed or is present in a negligible amount) ii. "lo" (the marker is expressed at a low level) iii. "mid" (the marker is expressed somewhere between a low and "normal" positive level for that cell type) iv. "+" (the marker is expressed at a normal positive level for that cell type) v. "hi" (the marker is expressed at a distinctly higher level than in cells that are "+", such that they are distinguishable from the "+" population and define their own subpopulation) vi. Although these designations are expected to be useful in the majority of cases, it is recognized that designations not listed here may be more appropriate in some cases. The data provider must determine the best way to designate an expression level suited to the purpose of the test, while striving to mitigate ambiguities resulting from lack of consistency of use. h. Explicitly indicating the cellular sublocation for a marker: In most cases, the location of a marker on or within a cell is not necessary; however, there are situations in which a marker can be expressed in more than a single cellular compartment and there is a need for the test to distinguish between marker expression in one compartment versus another. To accommodate this, using a lowercase letter in front of the marker is recommended. The cell sublocations are usually related to the cell surface (plasma membrane), cytoplasm, and nucleus. Use m, c, or n in front of the marker to denote "membrane", "cytoplasm", and "nucleus", respectively. An example of a marker often associated with a need to indicate cell location is CD152 (CTLA4), where cytoplasmic expression may define a test to distinguish it from whole cell expression. In this case, "cCD152" is used to denote that it is the cytoplasmic expression of CD152 that is measured for the test.

9. CPNRIND can be added to indicate where a result falls with respect to a reference range defined by
CPORNRLO and CPORNRHI (e.g., "HIGH", "LOW").
10. The variable CPORRESU uses the UNIT codelist. This means that sponsors should be submitting a term
from the CDISC Submission Value column in the published Controlled Terminology maintained for CDISC by NCI EVS. When sponsors have units that are not in this column, they should first check to see if their unit is mathematically synonymous with an existing unit and submit their lab values using that unit. If this is not the case, then a request for a new term (see https://ncitermform.nci.nih.gov/) should be submitted. CP – Examples The CP domain includes use of several new qualifier variables. The primary intent of the following examples is to demonstrate the appropriate use of these new variables based on a selection of use cases for which they would ordinarily be included in a well-structured CP dataset. Secondarily, the examples illustrate standardized formatting concepts for variables that are not associated with a formal Controlled Terminology codelist. Although not controlled, the standardized formatting of content for these variables significantly aids understanding of the test and associated data, making data review and comparisons much easier. To make the examples as easy to understand as possible, many of the other SDTM variables that would normally be included in the dataset and which are already familiar to the reader have not been included. The following new SDTM variables are included in the examples: CPSBMRKS (Sublineage Marker String), CPCELSTA (Cell State), CPCSMRKS (Cell State Marker String), CPTSTCND (Test Condition), CPCNDAGT (Test Condition Agent), CPBDAGNT (Binding Agent), CPABCLID (Antibody Clone Identifier), CPMRKSTR (Marker String), CPGATE (Gate), CPGATDEF (Gate Definition), CPSPTSTD (Sponsor Test Description), CPTSTPNL (Test Panel), CPRESSCL (Result Scale), CPRESTYP (Result Type), and CPCOLSRT (Collected Summary Result Type). The proper use of each of these variables is illustrated in 1 or more of the examples, based on the identified use case. Example 1 Example 1a illustrates use of the CPMRKSTR variable for an assay panel that enumerates several of the major named cell subpopulations of leukocytes. For most cases involving simple phenotyping, and when used in accordance with CP domain guidance, the CPMRKSTR variable is sufficient for providing the marker information needed to fully describe a test. As such, CPMRKSTR is the only new CP test qualifier variable having a Core designation of "Expected". In such a case, the sponsor may determine whether to include other permissible CP test qualifier variables, based on the needs of the data recipient. This example presents records that might typically be reported for a panel of tests quantifying T-cell, B-cell, monocyte, and natural killer (NK) cell populations, and for subtyping T-cells. In this example, the sponsor determined that none of the permissible CP test qualifier variables were needed to accurately comprehend or distinguish among tests in the dataset, so chose to include only the CPMRKSTR (complete markers string) information. Example 1b, in addition to including the expected CPMRKSTR variable, introduces 2 additional variables: CPGATE and CPGATDEF. These variables convey gating information used in data collection and/or analyses, and are often needed to fully understand a test. Typically, either the full gating strategy or the penultimate gate is identified. Because different gating strategies for the same test can yield somewhat different test results, the CPGATE and CPGATDEF variables provide the means for transmitting this information at the test (i.e., record) level. Example 1a Rows 1-3: The total leukocyte population is determined using positive expression of the CD45 marker as the operational definition of the test (CD45+ in the CPMRKSTR variable). The total leukocyte count is reported because it contains the value used as the denominator in several subsequent tests for leukocyte subpopulations. Row 2 contains the total lymphocyte count which, in addition to CD45, used Forward (FSC) and Side (SSC) Light Scatter properties to define the lymphocyte subpopulation of leukocytes. By convention, FSC and SSC are often not included as part of the marker string definition of a cell subpopulation since it is well-recognized that these physical properties are used as the first gate in nearly all cell phenotyping applications. However, in the absence of a pan-lymphocyte marker to distinguish them from other leukocytes, FSC and SSC are included in rows 2 and 3 to indicate that these parameters are used in addition to CD45, to differentiate lymphocytes from other


## Page 209

CD45+ leukocytes. Once they have been included in the marker string (CPMRKSTR) definition of lymphocytes, they can generally be dropped for any further subsetting of the lymphocytes population. Row 3 shows the proportion of lymphocytes as a percentage of total leukocytes. Note that the value in CPMRKSTR used a forward slash ("/") to separate the numerator marker string from the denominator marker string. Rows 4-5: The B-lymphocyte lineage of lymphocytes is determined using a set of lineage-specific markers in addition to the CD45 leukocyte marker, to define the subpopulation both in terms of positive (i.e., CD19+) and negative (i.e., CD3-, CD14-, and CD56-) marker expression. Following a common convention and CP domain guidance for ordering markers in CPMRKSTR, the marker(s) used to define the highest level of the lineage hierarchy are placed first (i.e., CD45+ defining the leukocyte population), followed by marker(s) that define each subsequently lower level of the hierarchy. The example also follows a convention whereby the set of positive and negative markers used to identify the major lineages of leukocytes are ordered by T-cell, B-cell, monocyte, and NK cell. In row 4, B lymphocytes are defined as leukocytes (CD45+), non-T-cell (CD3-), B-cell (CD19+), non-monocyte (CD14-), and non-NK cell (CD56-), resulting in a CPMRKSTR value of "CD45+CD3-CD19+CD14- CD56-". Row 5 shows that CPMRKSTR contains the full set of markers used to define both the numerator and the denominator, separated by a forward slash "/". Rows 6-7: The T-lymphocyte lineage of lymphocytes is determined using a set of lineage-specific markers in addition to the CD45 leukocyte marker, to define the subpopulation both in terms of positive (i.e., CD3+) and negative (i.e., CD19-, CD14-, and CD56-) marker expression. The order of markers in CPMRKSTR follows the same convention described for B-lymphocytes in rows 4 and 5. Rows 8-11: The T-lymphocyte lineage is divided further into T helper and T cytotoxic sublineages. In these examples the laboratory does not use the negative lineage markers for B-cells, monocytes, and NK cells, but used the positive T-cell (CD3) marker to identify the T-lymphocyte population, and additional markers to define subpopulations as either the T helper (CD4+CD8-) or T cytotoxic (CD4- CD8+) subpopulation. In rows 9 and 11, results are reported as a percentage of the total T-lymphocyte population. Using CPMRKSTR, the numerator is the marker string used to define the T helper subpopulation (as shown in row 8) or the T cytotoxic subpopulation (as shown in row 10), and the denominator consists of the marker string used to define the total T-lymphocyte population (as shown in row 6). A forward slash "/" is used to separate the numerator and denominator. Rows 12-13: The monocyte lineage of leukocytes is determined using a set of lineage-specific markers in addition to the CD45 leukocyte marker, to define the subpopulation both in terms of positive (i.e., CD14+) and negative (i.e., CD3-, CD19-, and CD56-) marker expression. The order of markers in CPMRKSTR follows the same convention described for B-lymphocytes in rows 4 and 5. In addition, the sponsor chose to include the FSC and SSC properties as markers because they are used, in part, to differentiate the monocyte and lymphocyte populations. Note that when FSC and SSC are used in a marker string, they usually go last, whereas they often come first when showing a gating strategy. Rows 14-15: The NK cell lineage of leukocytes is determined using a set of lineage-specific markers in addition to the CD45 leukocyte marker, to define the subpopulation both in terms of positive (i.e., CD56+) and negative (i.e., CD3-, CD19-, and CD14-) marker expression. The order of markers in CPMRKSTR follows the same convention described for B-lymphocytes in rows 4 and 5. In addition, the sponsor chose to include the FSC and SSC properties as markers because they are used, in part, to differentiate the natural killer cell and lymphocyte populations. Note that when FSC and SSC are used in a marker string, they usually go last, whereas they often come first when showing a gating strategy. Row 16: The ratio of T helper to T cytotoxic lymphocytes is calculated from the T helper (CD4+) cell count in row 8 and the T cytotoxic (CD8+) cell count in row 10 and a unit of measure is not included because it is not reported by the lab for this type of test.

Example 1b Row 1: The total leukocyte count is reported for a whole blood specimen in which the CD45 marker is used to identify the leukocyte population. FSC and SSC are used to exclude debris and non-singlets from data collection events. Because FSC and SSC are nearly always used in this manner in the first data collection gate, they are usually assumed and are often not reported (i.e., the sponsor could have chosen to leave CPGATDEF null). Rows 2-3: The total lymphocyte subpopulation of leukocytes is reported in row 2 as an absolute cell count, and in row 3 as a percentage of leukocytes. In these cases, FSC and SSC were used as subgates to isolate the lymphocyte lineage within the leukocyte (CD45+) population. Because FSC and SSC (in addition to the CD45 leukocyte marker) are used to define the lymphocyte lineage, they are included in CPMRKSTR, where they are used to distinguish between the lymphocyte and other leukocyte lineages. Row 4: Illustrates an alternative way a sponsor chose to construct the value of CPMRKSTR using the gate name in CPGATE (operationally defined in CPGATDEF) as the denominator. Although the preferred method for constructing CPMRKSTR is to use markers to define both the numerator and denominator, the method shown in this example for designating the denominator can be useful, particularly when the denominator string is merely a very long repeat of the majority of markers in the numerator. cp.xpt

Example 2 This example shows data from a lymphocyte apoptosis assay and how the new permissible variables CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS are used to indicate the biological state of the cell population measured in the test (e.g., viable, apoptotic, activated, exhausted, senescent, proliferating). Although in most cases only viable cells are measured in a test, making it unnecessary to specifically indicate their viability status in the dataset, there are other situations (e.g., when the ratio of viable to non-viable cells is of particular interest) when each cell state needs to be explicitly indicated in order to differentiate the tests. The principles illustrated in the example using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS variables also apply to more complex tests where the biological state of the cell population is considered to be integral to the test. Rows 1-2: Forward light scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) are almost always applied as the first gating parameters to distinguish singlets and viable cells from doublets and debris. In row 1, a lymphocyte (LYM) count is reported which does not explicitly provide viability information. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that FSC SSC gating is applied to exclude doublets, debris, and dead cells. Secondary FSC and SSC gating is then used to distinguish the lymphocyte population from other CD45+ leukocytes. In contrast, row 2 explicitly calls out cell viability based on the use of viability marker 7AAD to exclude cells that are in the process of dying (7AAD+). This is indicated in the Marker String (CPMRKSTR) and Gate Definition (CPGATEDEF) variables. In addition, the term "VIABLE" is included in the gate name (CPGATE). Rows 3-4: Illustrate using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS to provide (1) the cell state descriptor in CPCELSTA, and (2) the markers used to define the cell state in CPCSMRKS. These variables further define CPTEST to be a subset of cells named in CPTEST, therefore the suffix "Sub" is appended to the value in CPTEST. In this example, the sponsor is interested in contrasting viable cells with those in the process of dying (non-viable), so each population is reported and the records differentiated using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS. Rows 5-6: Illustrate using CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS for the apoptotic cell state. The sponsor is reporting the apoptotic lymphocyte subpopulation, both as a cell count (row 5) and as a percentage of total lymphocytes (row 6). The apoptotic cell state in CPCELSTA is defined as cells that are ANXV+ in CPCSMRKS. As in rows 3 and 4, the suffix "Sub" is added to the value in CPTEST to indicate that it is a subpopulation of lymphocytes (i.e., apoptotic) being measured. Rows 7-8: Illustrate using CPTEST, CPCELSTA, and CPCSMRKS variables to present findings when the cell population has more than a single cell state of interest (e.g., both viable and apoptotic). In this case, viability marker 7AAD is used in combination with apoptosis marker ANXV. Rows 9-11: Illustrate a need to pre-coordinate information into the test name when the test incorporates results from two or more records (e.g., a ratio) in which key component(s) of the test are split across multiple variables. In the example, rows 9 and 10 use the CPCELSTA variable to indicate that the measured lymphocyte subpopulation includes only viable cells (row 9) or dying (non-viable cells, row 10). The ratio of viable to nonviable lymphocytes in row 11 is calculated using data from rows 9 and 10. Because the ratio in row 11 is based on counts of both the viable (row 9) and the non-viable (row 10) lymphocyte subpopulations, it is not appropriate to use the CPCELSTA variable. Instead, the viability information is pre-coordinated into the value in CPTEST. Additionally, because the cell state (i.e., "VIABLE" or "NON-VIABLE") is pre-coordinated into the Test Name in row 11, the suffix "Sub" is no longer needed in CPTEST (i.e., the Test Name is "Lymphocytes Viable/Lymphocytes NonViable" rather than "Lymphocytes Sub Viable/Lymphocytes Sub NonViable". CPGRPID is used to group the related records for the ratio (row 11) with those used to calculate it (rows 9 and 10). cp.xpt

Example 3 This example shows data from a monocyte subset assay to highlight the use of new CP domain variables to capture cell sublineage information in CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS, and to illustrate how CPTEST is qualified by the content of those variables. CPTEST is used to identify named cell populations (i.e., those cell types assigned names established by the scientific community). However, simply naming a cell type in CPTEST is often not sufficient for identifying or distinguishing among further subpopulations within that named population. In those cases, CPTEST alone does not contain the full complement of information needed to accurately define a test. For example, a test might be specific for a cell population existing in a certain state (e.g., activated, proliferating, apoptotic). Moreover, named populations can often be subdivided into sublineages which have not been assigned names; these may only be distinguishable by including the 1 or more additional markers used to define the sublineage. To accommodate the need for further subsetting, 3 new variables that qualify CPTEST have been added to the CP domain specification for use when needed. Two of the variables, CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS, support identifying a cell state. The third variable, CPSBMRKS, supports identifying additional markers needed to subdivide the named population in CPTEST into further sublineages. In order to make it clear that 1 or more of these variables have been used to further subdivide CPTEST, the value of the named cell population in CPTEST is appended with "Sub" to denote that the true test is a subset, subpopulation, or sublineage of the parent population identified in CPTEST. When considering the need to use the CPSBMRKS variable, it is important to note that CPTEST is populated with the hierarchically lowest (most granular) named population, to which "Sub" is then appended. This ensures that CPSBMRKS contains only those additional marker(s) required to further differentiate subset(s) within the named population identified in CPTEST. For example, if 2 additional markers, CDxx and CDyy, are used to further classify T lymphocyte helper 2 cells into CDxx+CDyy- and CDxx-CDyy+ sublineages, CPTEST would contain the most granular named population (TLymHelp 2) appended with "Sub" in each of the 2 records (i.e., "TLym Help 2 Sub"), and CPSBMRKS would contain "CDxx+CDyy-" in 1 of the records and "CDxx-CDyy+" in the other. Rows 1-3: Show use of CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS to further subset the named cell population in CPTEST. In row 1, the total monocyte population, based on expression of CD14, is measured without any further subsetting. Rows 2 and 3 show that the monocyte population is further subdivided, based on the cell state, into "proliferating" and "non-proliferating" subpopulations as indicated by the CPCELSTA value. The value "Monocytes" in CPTEST for these rows is appended with "Sub" to "Monocytes Sub" to indicate that the record pertains to a subpopulation of monocytes (i.e., proliferating or non-proliferating). CPCELSTA is used to indicate that row 2 contains data for the proliferating subpopulation and row 3 contains data for the non-proliferating subpopulation. The CPCSMRKS variable is used to indicate that positive expression of the Ki67 marker (i.e., Ki67+) is used to identify the proliferating subpopulation and cells that do not express the Ki67 marker (i.e., Ki67-) is used to identify the non-proliferating subpopulation. The full set of markers used for the test are included in CPMRKSTR, and the cell gating strategy is identified in CPGATE and CPGATEDEF using the pipe character (|) to separate each level of the gate in CPGATEDEF. Rows 4-5: Show the proliferating (from row 2) and non-proliferating (from row 3) monocyte subpopulations expressed as a percentage of total monocytes (from row 1). The numerators in CPTEST for rows 4-5 use the named cell population appended with "Sub" (i.e., Monocytes Sub), and CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS are used to differentiate the proliferating and the non-proliferating subpopulations. The grouping value in CPGRPID indicates the data for monocytes in row 1 is used as the denominator for these tests. Data from rows 1-3 are used to perform the additional measurements shown in the tests defined in rows 4-6; CPGRPID is used to indicate which records belong to the group.

Row 6: Shows the ratio of the proliferating monocyte subpopulation to the non-proliferating monocyte subpopulation. For this calculated test, CPCELSTA and CPCSMRKS are not populated because (as in Example 2), the cell state information from rows 4 and 5 are pre-coordinated into the test name (CPTEST) in row 6. Pre-coordination of the cell state into the test name also eliminates the need to append "Sub" to the cell name in the numerator and denominator of the test. CPMRKSTR contains the full marker string for each side of the ratio. CPGRPID is used to indicate which grouping of related records are used to perform the calculation. In the example, the lab did not provide "RATIO" as a unit of measure for the test and the sponsor chose not to include "RATIO" in CPORRESU and CPSTRESU, but did include it as the Result Type in CPRESTYP. Rows 7-9: Show use of CPSBMRKS to further subset the named cell population in CPTEST into sublineages based on expression of additional markers CDxx and CDyy. In row 7, the total monocyte population, based on expression of CD14, is measured without any further subsetting. Rows 8 and 9 show that this monocyte population is further subdivided into two distinct sublineages, based on expression of CDxx and CDyy. Because those sublineages do not have established names, they are distinguished from one another using the CPSBMRKS variable. The value of "Monocytes" in the CPTEST variable for these rows is appended with the "Sub" suffix to "Monocytes Sub". The CPSBMRKS variable is used to indicate that row 8 contains data for the CDxx+CDyy- monocyte sublineage and row 9 contains data for the CDxx-CDyy+ sublineage. The full set of markers used for the test are included in CPMRKSTR, and the cell gating strategy is identified in CPGATE and CPGATEDEF using the pipe character (|) to separate each level of the gate in CPGATEDEF. Rows 10-11: Show the monocyte sublineages defined in rows 8-9 expressed as a percentage of total monocytes (row 7). The numerators in CPTEST for rows 10-11 use the named cell population appended with "Sub" (i.e., "Monocytes Sub"), and CPSBMRKS is used to differentiate the CDxx+CDyy- from the CDxx-CDyy+ sublineages. CPGRPID indicates that the result for monocytes in row 7 is used as the denominator. Data from rows 7-9 are used to perform the additional measurements shown in the tests defined in rows 10-11; CPGRPID is used to indicate which records belong to the group. Row 12: Demonstrates how CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, and CPCSMRKS work in combination with CPTEST to further define cell subpopulations based on any additional sublineage and cell state markers. The model allows for many combinations of values using these variables, thereby providing the flexibility to precisely specify a test. In all cases, the full complement of markers used for a test are populated into the CPMRKSTR variable. cp.xpt

1. Because not all cellular markers are expressed constitutively at detectable levels, an externally applied condition may need to be added to the test system to enable measurement or to test the functionality of
the cell population being investigated. CPTSTCND was developed to capture any variable condition (i.e., a condition which can vary as opposed to is fixed) imposed on the assay system at the time the assay is conducted. Its primary use is when it is needed to differentiate results for the same test and specimen run under different assay conditions (e.g., stimulated vs unstimulated).
2. Repeated measures (replicates) are typically incorporated into an assay to monitor reproducibility and may be reported in addition to a summarized result value. CPREPNUM and CPCOLSRT have been
developed to distinguish replicate results from calculated summary results (e.g., the mean of replicates). Rows 1-3: Illustrate how the test condition (CPTSTCND), replicates (REPNUM) and collected summary result type (CPCOLSRT) are used for a test system involving unstimulated CCR5+ cytotoxic Tlymphocytes. The two replicates and mean of the unstimulated condition are reported. Rows 4-6: Illustrate the association between CPTSTCND, which identifies the condition applied to the assay system at runtime, and CPCNDAGT, which identifies the agent (if appropriate) used to impose the condition. CPREPNUM and CPCOLSRT are used as described for rows 1-3. Row 7: Shows the record for the ratio of the stimulated to unstimulated populations based on mean results (i.e., records with CPCOLSRT = "MEAN"). The CPANMETH variable is populated with the formula used to calculate the result. Note that calculated values provided in a lab report are considered collected rather than derived. cp.xpt

Example 5 This example shows data from a B-lymphocyte activation assay with single-marker quantitation of a cell state marker using the formatting guidance for CPTEST and CPMRKSTR. It also demonstrates the use of CPGATE and CPGATDEF for reporting a full gating strategy and for reporting the total number of events counted within a gate. Rows 1-3: Incorporates both standard proportion analysis and single marker expression for a cell state marker in the B lymphocyte assay using CPGRPID to group the related record. In accordance with CP guidance for quantitative single marker expression, row 3 contains the marker being measured followed by "Expression". CPMRKSTR uses the recommended format of listing the marker being measured first, followed by the unit in which expression was quantified (median fluorescence intensity, MdFI in the example), and lastly by the complete marker string of the cell population on which expression was measured. The analyte is repeated as part of the target cell population string (CD95+ in the example). GATE and GATEDEF show the gating strategy so it is clear which gate was used to make the quantitative measurement of expression. Rows 4-8: Show a set of tests similar to those in rows 1-3, except that the marker being quantified is more narrowly restricted to a subpopulation of B lymphocytes (i.e., naive B cells), which are identified using a richer set of markers. The sponsor chose, in row 6, to include the total number of events counted in the final gate to document that the data are reliable based on a sample size sufficient to reduce error to an appropriate level (e.g. 2-sigma).

Example 6 This example shows use of CPSPTSTD for the lab/sponsor to describe a test in detail using internal data repository/dictionary nomenclature which has been developed for the test. The example uses a complex dendritic cell (DC) assay panel to illustrate information appropriate for this variable. With the advent of increasingly complex phenotypic assays used to measure proportions, counts, and expression levels on cell subpopulations, it is sometimes advantageous for a lab/sponsor to provide a more thorough test description in a format used internally to represent a test and/or that a data recipient can more readily understand. For example, when quantitative marker expression is reported, CPTEST does not indicate the cell population on which expression was measured. Although the marker string of the target cell population is included in CPMRKSTR, the actual name of the cell is lost unless it is included as part of the gate name in CPGATE or in CPSPTSTD. CPSPTSTD (Sponsor Test Description) provides the flexibility for combining pieces of information that make the test easier to understand and to track internally to lab/sponsor dictionaries using a single variable which is not managed by CDISC Controlled Terminology. Rows 1-6: Illustrate how the sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to combine details of a test into a single variable to align with the lab/sponsor data repository or dictionary and to aid understanding of the test. Rows 1-4 introduce CPSPTSTD using simple tests for dendritic cells to set the stage for the more complex tests shown in rows 5-6. Those rows incorporate an additional marker (CD1c-) to define the plasmacytoid sublineage, and a non-lineage, non-cell state marker (CD303+) that is of interest. Although the entire marker string is in CPMRKSTR, it is easy to miss that CD303+ was also used to subdivide the population, even though it is not considered to define a sublineage. The lab/sponsor test nomenclature reinforces the use of CD303 by calling them a "CD303+ Dendritic Cell Plasmacytoid Sub" (subset) in the CPSPTSTD for rows 5-6. The information presented by the lab/sponsor helps the data recipient to quickly understand such nuances of a test at a glance, which is especially useful as the complexity of a test increases. Rows 7-10: Illustrate how CPSPTSTD might preface the name of a cell population with cell state marker(s) (e.g., CD83+ in rows 7-8) in addition to non-cell state, non-sublineage marker(s). Rows 9-10 additionally show that the lab/sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to identify the target cell population by name when it is not in CPTEST, such as when the test is for quantitative single marker expression (CD83 Expression in rows 9-10). Rows 11-14: Same as rows 7-10, except here the cell state activation marker for the CD303+ pDC cell subset and the single marker expression measurement is CD80. Rows 15-18: Illustrate how CPSPTSTD might preface the name of a cell population with cell sublineage marker(s) (e.g., CD40+ in rows 15-16 in addition to non-cell state, non-sublineage marker(s). Rows 17-18 additionally show that the lab/sponsor uses CPSPTSTD to identify the target cell population by name when it is not in CPTEST, such as when the test is for quantitative single marker expression (CD40 Expression in rows 17-18). Rows 19-32: No new concepts are introduced in these rows, but they are additional illustrations of using CPSBMRKS, CPCELSTA, CPCSMRKR and CPSPTSTD for a subset of pDC in which CD123+ is a marker of interest which is neither a cell sublineage nor cell state marker. These rows are included to reinforce the principles illustrated in rows 1-18.

Example 7 This example shows data from a monocyte target occupancy assay for which a cell surface marker of interest is bound to its specific protein or ligand (identified in CPBDAGNT) upon sample analysis. In addition, three different ways for populating CPGATE and CPGATDEF are shown in the example. Principles related to cell phenotyping are often used to measure the extent of binding between two molecules of interest (e.g., ligand-receptor or protein-protein interactions). Substances involved in the binding interaction can represent naturally occurring, pathological (i.e., disease-related), or therapeutic intervention processes. Quantification of these types of interactions is often used: (1) to aid in diagnosis and/or tracking disease progression; (2) to determine whether a therapy operating through a binding mechanism works as intended at selected doses; and (3) to assess whether potential off-target interactions, particularly those associated with undesirable side effects or safety risks, are likely to be a concern. Row 1: The sponsor chose to submit only the final calculated result for target occupancy as reported by the lab, i.e., records used for the calculation were not submitted. The CPMRKSTR variable includes markers identifying the cell population (CD45+CD14+) and the target of interest (CDxx) on which occupancy was measured. CPGATE contains the name of the gate used to virtually isolate the cell population of interest and CPGATEDEF contains the gate definition or gating strategy. Note in this example that the CDxx marker, although it is the target of interest for the test, is not part of the string used to formally identify the named portion of the cell population. As a result, the sponsor chose to report the penultimate gate, which does not include the target marker of interest (CDxx). Because the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name, it is identified in CPBDAGNT and/or another variable (e.g. CPTSTPNL). Row 2: Same as row 1 except that the sponsor chose to use CPGATE and CPGATDEF to report information for the final gate rather than the penultimate gate. In this example, the CDxx marker (the target of interest for measuring occupancy) is not part of the marker string used to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the test was performed, so it was placed in front of the named portion of the gate to make it easily understood that the final gate was on CDxx-positive monocytes (i.e., CDxx+ MONOCYTES). Because the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name, it is identified in CPBDAGNT and/or another variable (e.g. CPTSTPNL). Row 3: The target of interest is also a marker needed to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the occupancy was measured. For example, proinflammatory monocytes are distinguished from monocytes based on additional marker expression criteria as CD16+HLADRhi. In the example, the CD16 marker was also the target of interest for measuring occupancy. Because CD16 is included in the set of markers used to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the test was performed, it does not need to be explicitly called out in CPGATE.

Example 8 The example is a use case for data from a receptor occupancy study based on a direct cell-binding assay method to illustrate the use of several new variables. In the example, target engagement is assessed by measuring the extent to which a cell-associated target protein (the hypothetical cell marker CDxx) is occupied by a therapeutic antibody (CDxx antibody) intended to interact with it. The assay uses a labeled detection antibody to the therapeutic antibody to measure the proportion of the target bound by the therapeutic antibody in an unaltered specimen (numerator), as compared to the total amount of target available for binding (denominator). The total target available for binding is assessed by saturating the specimen with the therapeutic antibody before measuring the labeled detection antibody. To correct the numerator and denominator for non-specific (background) binding, labeled isotype controls are included which are subtracted to yield specific binding values. Although sponsors may elect to only report the final calculated receptor occupancy (proportion of bound/total target occupied) as in Example 7, this example includes the various measured parameters generated in the assay which are then used to make calculations for the final Receptor Occupancy value. Since the example is measuring binding and not a cell population per se, the Sublineage Marker String (CPSBMRKS), Cell State (CPCELSTA), and Cell State Marker String (CPCSMRKS) are not used and are not included. Other variables such as CPMRKSTR, CPGATE, and CPGATEDEF are used to identify the cell population on which the binding of interest was measured. In addition, the Sponsor Test Description (CPSPTSTD) and Test Panel (CPTSTPNL) variables may be helpful for identifying a specific cell population. Rows 1-3: Illustrate how the test name (CPTEST), marker string (CPMRKSTR), binding agent (CPBDAGNT), replicates (CPREPNUM), and summary result type (CPCOLSRT) are populated for data from an assay used to assess target engagement by measuring the occupancy of the CDxx cell-associated target protein expressed on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (defined as CD45+CD3+CD8+CDxx+). In this direct assay, CPBDAGNT identifies the CDxx antibody (therapeutic antibody) as the target-bound substance of interest. Two replicate determinations and the mean extent of CDxx bound in the unaltered specimen are indicated using CPREPNUM and CPCOLSRT. Rows 4-6: CPTEST, CPBDAGNT, REPNUM, and CPCOLSRT are used the same manner as they are in rows 1-3, except that CPTSTCND is now also used to indicate that the assay was conducted under a saturating condition of CDxx antibody by adding an excess of this therapeutic antibody to the assay system. Under this condition, the labeled detection antibody reflects the maximum (total) amount of CDxx available to be occupied by the therapeutic antibody, Rows 7-8: Show values for background (i.e. non-specific) binding of the labeled detection antibody to the CDxx-expressing cells of interest by using an isotype control belonging to the same immunoglobulin class/subclass as the therapeutic antibody. This is indicated in CPBDAGNT and is also shown for how the sponsor chose to represent it in CPMRKSTR. Rows 9-11: Rows 9 and 10 show values for specific binding of the therapeutic antibody (CDxx antibody) in the unaltered (native) specimen (Row 9) and the specimen to which excess CDxx antibody was added (saturated assay condition) (Row 10). Specific binding was determined by subtracting the appropriate background measured in Rows 7 and 8 from the mean target bound (Row 3) and mean target total (Row 6). Row 11 shows the final result for CDxx antibody occupancy on the CDxx target protein as the quotient of the specific binding in the native specimen (Row 9) to the specific binding measuring the total CDxx available for binding (Row 10).

Example 9 This example shows data from a monocyte receptor occupancy indirect detection assay for a target of interest relying upon externally applied assay conditions and several binding agents to measure the parameters reported. Under certain circumstances, assessment of changes to free or unoccupied receptor (target) binding over the time-course of drug therapy or use of an indirect assay format may be more appropriate than direct detection of a binding agent (e.g., drug, small molecule ligand, protein) to obtain information on the extent of target engagement. Indirect assays of this sort rely on measuring remaining free (unbound) binding site using a labeled competitive detection probe (e.g., antibody or other ligand) that binds to the remaining available sites on the target; that is, those sites not already occupied by treating with the therapeutic. (Occupancy of the target by the therapeutic agent is then calculated as the difference between the total number of binding sites and the number of free binding sites detected by the probe.) In addition to measuring the free binding sites, a second labeled probe which binds to a non-interfering alternate site on the target (i.e., is non-competitive with the therapeutic molecule) may be used to assess the total amount of the target molecule expressed on cells (not binding sites) in order to monitor whether therapy changed the number of targets available relative to baseline expression. This allows results to be interpreted as a change in occupancy as opposed to a change in the number of targets available. Sponsors may choose to report a single test for the final calculated occupancy, such as shown in row 1, or may elect to include results for the entire set of tests conducted which were then used to calculate the final occupancy result, such as shown in rows 2 through 14. In the example showing the full set of tests, data are reported for free and total binding, background (non-specific) binding, and specific binding. CPBDAGNT is used to identify the probe (detection) antibody for each type of test (HA5-PE or 2D4-APC). Specific free binding (Target Free, Delta Free Background) is calculated as the difference in the probe signal (measured as MESF) between an untreated assay tube to a tube treated with unlabeled probe antibody under saturating concentrations (to measure non-specific binding, which is not diminished under saturating conditions). CPTSTCND is used to capture the saturated condition imposed on the assay at runtime. Receptor Occupancy is calculated as the difference between pre- and post-treatment binding of the labeled competitive probe (HA5) normalized to pre-treatment binding. Row 1: The sponsor chose to submit only the final calculated result for target occupancy as reported by the lab; the data used in the calculation were not submitted. CPMRKSTR includes markers identifying the cell population (CD45+CD14+) and the target of interest (CD99) on which occupancy was measured. CPGATE contains the name of the gate used to virtually isolate the cell population of interest and

CPGATEDEF contains the gate definition/gating strategy. Note that in this example the CD99 marker, although it is the target of interest for the test, it is not part of the marker string used to identify the named portion of the cell population on which the test was performed. As a result, the sponsor chose to report the penultimate gate, which does not include the target marker of interest (CD99). Because the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name (CPTEST), it is identified using CPBDAGNT and/or as part of the panel name in CPTSTPNL. The CPCAT and CPSCAT variables are used to indicate that the assay is intended for target engagement and that the assay is measuring receptor occupancy. Rows 2-7: The CD99 marker is identified as the target of interest for measuring occupancy. Because the target of interest for which occupancy was measured is not part of the test name (CPTEST), it is identified using CPBDAGNT and/or CPTSTPNL. The CPTSTCND variable defines the condition imposed on the assay at runtime to for measuring background binding. CPGRPID groups individual measured tests to the calculated test value derived from them. Because final results involve comparing specific binding of free or total receptor for the baseline occupancy to a 24-hour post-treatment set of results (rows 8-14), time point information for specimen collection is included in CPTPT and CPTPTNUM. Rows 2-4 show results for measurement of free target using a labeled competitive antibody probe (HA5) and rows 5-7 show results for measurement of total CD99 on the monocyte cell target population using a labeled non-competitive antibody probe (2D4). The total CD99 measurement is a control to monitor for any difference in CD99 expression that might exist between the pre-dose and post-dose specimens that could bias the relative occupancy. They are not used to calculate occupancy of the CD99 target, as the relative expression of CD99 at the post-dose time point is comparable to the pre-dose expression (7253 vs 7530 MESF). Rows 8-14: Show the same set of tests collected for baseline (rows 2-7) but measured 24 hours after treatment with the therapeutic drug, which binds in situ to CD99. The reported receptor occupancy is for the 24hour post-treatment time point relative to pre-dose with the therapeutic CD99 binding drug. cp.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. GF – Assumptions
1. The Genomics Findings domain is used to represent findings related to the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of subject and non-host
organism genomic material of interest. This domain includes but is not limited to assessments and results for genetic variation and transcription, and summary measures derived from these assessments. The GF domain is used for findings from characteristics assessed from nucleic acids and may include subsequent inferences and/or predictions about related proteins/amino acids. However, direct assessments of proteins (e.g., assessments of amino acids) are out of scope for this domain.
2. Regarding genetic testing on non-host organisms (including but not limited to bacteria, viruses, and parasites), the following additional assumptions
apply: a. Tests that give genetic results (e.g., expressed in terms of genetic variation, specific sequence information) on non-host organisms that have been identified in subject samples should be represented in GF. To distinguish these findings from subject genetic data, the variable NHOID must be populated to identify the non-host organism as the focus of the record (see Section 9.2, Non-host Organism Identifiers, assumption 2 for more information). b. If the purpose of the test is to detect or determine the identity of a viable, non-host organism or infectious agent in a subject sample, data should be represented in the Microbiology Specimen (MB) domain. c. Tests that are used to determine the resistance/susceptibility of a non-host organism to a drug on a genetic basis should be represented in the Microbiology Susceptibility (MS) domain.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GFREPNUM | Repetition Number | Num |  | Record<br>Qualifier | The instance number of a test that is repeated within a given timeframe for the same test performed by | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | the wet lab. |  |
| VISITNUM | Visit Number | Num |  | Timing | Clinical encounter number. Numeric version of VISIT, used for sorting. | Exp |
| VISIT | Visit Name | Char |  | Timing | Protocol-defined description of clinical encounter. | Perm |
| VISITDY | Planned Study Day of<br>Visit | Num |  | Timing | Planned study day of VISIT. Should be an integer. | Perm |
| GFDTC | Date/Time of Specimen<br>Collection | Char | ISO 8601 datetime<br>or interval | Timing | Date and time of specimen collection. | Exp |
| GFDY | Study Day of Specimen<br>Collection | Num |  | Timing | Actual study day of visit/collection/exam expressed in integer days relative to the sponsor-defined | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | RFSTDTC in Demographics. |  |
| GFTPT | Planned Time Point<br>Name | Char |  | Timing | Text description of time when a measurement or observation should be taken as defined in the | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | protocol. This may be represented as an elapsed time relative to a fixed reference point, such as time |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | of last dose. See GFTPTNUM and GFTPTREF. |  |
| GFTPTNUM | Planned Time Point<br>Number | Num |  | Timing | Numerical version of GFTPT used in sorting. | Perm |
| GFELTM | Planned Elapsed Time<br>from Time Point Ref | Char | ISO 8601 duration | Timing | Elapsed time relative to a planned fixed reference (GFTPTREF). This variable is useful where there | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | are repetitive measures. Not a clock time or a date time variable, but an interval, represented as ISO |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | duration. |  |
| GFTPTREF | Time Point Reference | Char |  | Timing | Name of the fixed reference point referred to by GFELTM, GFTPTNUM, and GFTPT. Examples: | Perm |

d. If the test provides both genetic data and susceptibility/resistance data, genetic data should be represented in GF and the susceptibility/resistance data should be represented in the MS domain (See Section 6.3.5.7.2, Microbiology Susceptibility, assumption 1b for more information).
3. The platform used to detect the finding may be represented in SPDEVID. Attributes used in conjunction with a platform (e.g., assay panel, reagents)
may be represented in the Device Identifiers (DI) domain and other associated device domains. See the SDTM Implementation Guide for Medical Devices (SDTMIG-MD) for further information about SPDEVID and the device domains.
4. Values populated in GFCAT and GFSCAT are sponsor-defined and there is no CDISC Controlled Terminology for these variables.
5. Genomic symbols are represented in GFSYM.
a. GFTESTCD and GFTEST should not include genomic names or symbols, including but not limited to official gene symbols. b. For human genetic data, standard nomenclature populated in variable GFSYM must be obtained from the genomic symbol list maintained in the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database (www.genenames.org).
6. When populating GFGENSR, caution should be exercised for annotations of loci where more than 1 annotation applies. In such cases, the source of the
annotation should be captured and documented in Define-XML. In addition, the value populated in GFGENSR may be dependent on the precision of the value populated in GFSEQID.
7. Values populated in GFGENREF, GFSEQID, and GFPVRID should reflect the level of granularity collected (e.g., version, build, patch, release) to
support interpretation of the reported result.
8. GFMETHOD lists wet lab techniques for the execution of genomics or genetic testing. Methods related to specimen processing or reagents are
not represented in GFMETHOD.
9. The following variables generally would not be used in GF: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, ORNRHI,--STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --
CHRON, --DISTR, --ANTREG, --LOC, --LAT, --DIR, --PORTOT, --LEAD, --CSTATE, --SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV. GF – Examples Example 1 This example shows findings from an assessment of single nucleotide and copy number variation generated from biocomputational analysis with wet laboratory methodology targeted genome sequencing. Findings from this assessment show variation from DNA extracted from an individual's tumor tissue. As the DNA specimen was extracted from tumor tissue, the inheritabilty of the variation is considered to be somatic. Row 1: Shows the predicted amino acid change due to the single nucleotide variant. Row 2: Shows the predicted coding sequence change due to the single nucleotide variant. Row 3: Shows the classification of the variant impact given the predicted amino acid change. Row 4: Shows the number of times the locus specified in variables GFCHROM and GFGENLOC was observed. Row 5: Shows the percent variant read depth to total read depth. Row 6: Shows the number of copies of the gene of interest within the genome of the tumor cell. Row 7: Shows the number of altered exons within the gene of interest in the genome of the tumor cell.


## Page 225

Row 8: Shows the ratio of the copy number of the gene of interest in the tumor cell to the reference number of copies. Row 9: Shows the interpretation of the copy number of the gene of interest within the genome of the tumor cell. gf.xpt

Identifying information for the gene panel used to generate the result is in the DI domain. The gene panel is represented in SDTM, as the panel used as part of the wet laboratory methodology may change and affects interpretation of the result. The platform in which the gene panel was used is not represented, because it does not provide additional context for the result. The DI example shows the device type and manufacturer for the device identified as ACME GenePanel 500. di.xpt

Example 2 This example shows findings from an assessment of a known single nucleotide variant in gene ABCG2 using wet laboratory methodology real-time polymerase chain reaction. Findings from this assessment show the genotypes from DNA extracted from the blood of 3 individuals, each with a different genotype at the genetic locus of interest. Because the DNA specimen was extracted from normal blood, the inheritability of the variation is considered to be in the germline. Row 1: Shows a subject genotype which is homozygous for the variant nucleotide in the reference sequence. Row 2: Shows a subject genotype which is heterozygous for the nucleotide in the reference sequence. Row 3: Shows a subject genotype which is homozygous for the nucleotide in the reference sequence. gf.xpt

Identifying information for the gene panel used to generate the result is in the DI domain. The gene panel is represented in SDTM, as the panel used as part of the wet laboratory methodology may change and affects interpretation of the result. The platform in which the gene panel was used is not represented, because it does not provide additional context for the result. The DI example shows the device type and manufacturer for the device identified as ACME GenePanel 250. di.xpt

Example 4 This example shows findings from an assessment of microsatellite instability for genetic subregions that are known to be unstable. DNA extracted from tumor tissue is amplified and the resulting amplicons are resolved using wet laboratory methodology capillary electrophoresis. Row 1: Shows the summarized interpretation of overall microsatellite instability. Rows 2-6: Show whether microsatellite instability is detected in the genetic subregions indicated. gf.xpt

Example 5 This example includes 3 datasets (i.e., MB and MS in addition to GF). The purpose of this 3-part example is to illustrate how these domains are appropriately used in cases where the concepts in each domain are very closely related. Specifically, the example demonstrates the use of these domains by following a subject through a hypothetical scenario of influenza diagnosis, genetic evaluation of the virus, and interpretation of drug susceptibility resulting from genetic testing. Tests that diagnose or identify the presence of an infectious agent in a subject sample are represented in the MB domain, regardless of the methodology used. In this example, the subject was diagnosed with influenza A H3N2 via a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the baseline visit. MBTEST = "Microbial Organism Identification" because the assay does not specifically test for the presence of 1 organism or subtype to the exclusion of all others. mb.xpt

Next, a series of virus samples extracted from the subject underwent targeted single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) testing to determine the feasibility of using the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir to treat the infection (i.e., drug susceptibility testing). Findings from this testing provide both genetic data in the form of the genotype identified and the susceptibility/resistance data as inferred phenotype. Genotypic findings are represented in the GF domain, and inferred susceptibility/resistance in MS. The GFTEST "Single Nucleotide Variation" is used for SNP tests. GFTSTDTL indicates that the results are expressed as predicted amino acid change instead of nucleotide change. GFSYM = "NA", the published gene symbol for the influenza neuraminidase gene. GFGENLOC represents the position in the protein sequence where the targeted variation which confers resistance to oseltamivir occurs. GFSEQID is the reference sequence/segment to which the results are compared. Note the use of NHOID, which is populated with the name of the organism to which the testing applies. Note: It is important to use this identifier to distinguish between tests that apply to a non-host organism and tests that apply to the study subject/host.

GFLNKID serves as the link between this dataset and the MS dataset which follows. Row 1: Shows the result of a targeted test to detect a single nucleotide polymorphism in the influenza neuraminidase gene known to confer resistance to the drug oseltamivir. The result (R292R) indicates that the amino acid residue R (arginine) at position 292 remains unchanged at the baseline visit Rows 2-3: Show the results of the same targeted test at the day 2 and day 5 visits. The results (R292K) show that a mutation has occurred at position 292 from the amino acid R (arginine) to the amino acid K (lysine). gf.xpt

The susceptibility data stemming from this genetic testing above are represented in MS (see Section 6.3.5.7.2, Microbiology Susceptibility, assumption 1b). GFLINKID matches MSLNKID to connect the records in GF with the corresponding conclusion regarding susceptibility in MS. As above, NHOID is used to indicate that influenza A H3N2 is the focus of these records. MSAGENT represents the drug to which the results of susceptible or resistant pertain. Row 1: Shows the influenza extracted from the subject at the baseline visit is susceptible to oseltamivir. Rows 2-3: Show the influenza extracted from the subject at the day 2 and day 5 visits is resistant to oseltamivir. ms.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. IS – Assumptions
1. The Immunogenicity Specimen Assessments (IS) domain holds assessments that describe whether a therapy (e.g., biologic, drug, vaccine)
provoked/caused/induced an immune response in a subject. The response can be either positive or negative. For example, a vaccine is expected to induce a beneficial immune response, whereas a cellular therapy (e.g., erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) may cause an adverse immune response.
2. The IS domain also holds assessments that describe whether an allergen, microorganism, or endogenous molecule provoked/caused/induced an immune
response in a subject, such as a subject's antibody reaction (autoantibodies) against auto/self-antigens for autoimmune studies or antibody production in response to allergens in allergy trials. Expected outputs can be positive or negative, present or absent for the antibody of interest, as well as quantification of the antibody. Assessments pertaining to antibodies produced in response to microbial infection will also be represented in the IS domain.

3. Assessments about all other types of "induced" humoral (antibody) immune response in a subject (e.g., antibodies against human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) proteins) will also be represented in the IS domain.
4. Certain types of cellular immune responses will also be modeled in IS using non-flow cytometry techniques (see example 6). Flow cytometry data
should be modeled in the Cell Phenotype Findings (CP) domain, section 6.3.5.3.
5. An exception is made to the class of antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination assays. Microbial antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination tests should be
represented in the Microbiology Specimen (MB) domain. An example is fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combination tests, which are commonly seen as HIV identification or detection assays rather than tests that provide additional details on and characterization of a subject’s immunological responses. The outputs of these assays can be expected as reactive, non-reactive, or indeterminate. Whereas some tests generate separate outputs for antigen and antibody, others just indicate “reactive” when either or both are detected. Output is generally based on relative light units, where a result of "reactive" typically requires the signal to cutoff ratio to be greater than 1.
6. Measurements of cytokines, chemokines, and complement proteins should be represented in the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain.
7. The IS domain variable ISBDAGNT (Binding Agent) is currently supported by 2 Controlled Terminology codelists: Microorganism (MICROORG) and
Binding Agent for Immunogenicity Tests (ISBDAGT). Controlled Terminology Rules for Immunogenicity Tests describes how and when to use each codelist (see https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology). a. For antidrug antibody (ADA) tests, the ISBDAGNT variable is used to represent the free-text description of the name/identity of the therapy the antidrug antibody targets. CDISC does not control study therapy names (e.g., drugs, biologics). For ADA tests as a part of regulatory agency submissions, the proprietary binding study therapy name(s) should be considered as extended values of the ISBDAGT codelist when represented in Define-XML. b. For mixed-allergens panel tests, submission values represented in the ISBDAGNT variable should follow this format: “XXX, Multiple” (e.g., Dairy Mix Antigens, Multiple; Animal Mix Antigens, Multiple; use the plural form for the word “antigen” if needed). Should the sponsor wish to specify the individual antigens in a mixed antigens panel (e.g., ISBDAGNT = “Animal Mix Antigens, Multiple”), put the names of the specific antigens in Suppqual (e.g., Cat, Dog, Cow, Horse; see example 11).
8. The IS domain variable ISTSTOPO (Test Operational Objective) is supported by a nonextensible Controlled Terminology codelist containing the values
SCREEN, CONFIRM, and QUANTIFY.
9. For vaccine studies, in order to distinguish collected data between study vaccine-induced immunogenicity and immunogenicity findings unrelated to the
study vaccine (i.e., immunity as a result of natural infection or previous vaccination), the following ISCAT and ISSCAT values are recommended (see example 5): a. For immunological data pertaining to the study vaccine, ISCAT = STUDY VACCINE-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY. b. For immunological data collected during the vaccine trial but which are not assessments about the study vaccine, ISCAT = NON-STUDY- RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY. c. For assessments measuring the induced-antibody response, ISSCAT = HUMORAL IMMUNITY. d. For assessments measuring the induced-cellular response, ISSCAT = CELLULAR IMMUNITY.
10. Any Identifier variables, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the IS domain.

IS – Examples Example 1 This example shows data from tiered testing of antidrug antibody (ADA). Tiered testing scheme for ADA evaluation generally includes the following steps: screening, confirmatory, and "characterization" of the antidrug antibody. In tier 1, all evaluable samples are run in a screening assay. Samples that are positive for ADA in the screen assay are then analyzed in a confirmatory assay (tier 2). The samples that are positive for ADA in both the screen and confirmatory tiers of testing are further tested in tier 3; this frequently includes analysis of antibody titer and neutralizing activity. In order to illustrate the distinctive differences between the 3 tiers of ADA testing, the standard variable ISTSTOPO is used to represent the controlled values SCREEN, CONFIRM, and QUANTIFY. These values help to describe the operational objective or the reason behind each testing step/tier, and also to provide uniqueness to each row of record. The study drug AZ-007, which induces the subject's production of, and is the target of the antidrug antibody, is represented by the variable ISBDAGNT. ISGRPID is used in this example to show that the records are related to each other; in this particular case, tests are done in a tiered, sequential manner from screen to confirm to quantification of the detected antidrug antibody. Lastly, antibody titer is often defined as the reciprocal of the lowest dilution of a sample generating a signal that is above the assay cut-point. Alternatively, the titer is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of a sample generating a signal that is equivalent to the assay cut-point, calculated by an interpolation formula provided in an assay specific bioanalytical method. Row 1: Shows the screening of the presence of ADA to drug AZ-007. Row 2: Shows the confirmation of the previously detected ADA to drug AZ-007. Row 3: Shows the measurement of titer of the ADA from the screen and confirmatory steps. is.xpt

Example 2 This example shows data from various subtypes of ADA tests. Although most ADAs do not inhibit the pharmacodynamic activity of a drug, neutralizing antidrug antibodies (NAbs) can inhibit drug activity soon after a drug is administered. Most ADAs (those that are not classified as NAbs) can lower the drug's systemic exposure by increasing the rate of drug clearance, resulting in a clinically similar outcome to that of NAbs (i.e., reduced clinical efficacy). In this example, the administered drug is an analogue of an endogenous protein. The example data include ADA reactions against both the administered drug and the endogenous protein. Both the study drug and the endogenous protein are represented by the standard variable ISBDAGNT, which qualifies ISTEST. The variable ISTSTOPO, is also used in this dataset to describe the purpose of each testing step, and provides uniqueness among similar records. ISGRPID is used to show which records are related in this dataset. Note that, in this example, even though only confirmatory records are reported and shown, it is assumed that the screening step has also been performed. Rows 1-2: Show the confirmation and quantification of binding ADA to coagulation factor VIII analogue drug. A binding antidrug antibody is an antibody that binds to a drug. Rows 3-4: Show the confirmation and quantification of the neutralizing binding ADA to coagulation factor VIII analogue drug. A neutralizing binding antidrug antibody is a type of ADA that binds to the functional portion of a drug, leading to diminished or negated pharmacological activity. The neutralizing ADAs are a subset of the total ADAs.

Example 3 This example shows data about ADA reaction against drug components. This example shows the production of ADA in response to both the prodrug and its active metabolite.

Example 4 This example shows data about ADA reaction against multiple epitopes of a drug molecule. This example shows the production of ADA in response to the study biologic drug, peginterferon beta-1a; its active metabolite, active interferon beta 1a; and its immunogenic epitope, PEG epitope of peginterferon beta-1a. An immunogenic epitope of a biologic drug is a particular segment within the drug that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. This immunogenic epitope portion of the biologic drug is capable of inducing the production of and therefore the binding of ADAs. This example also shows when tiered testing stops at the screening step (interferon beta1a assay) and goes straight to neutralizing antidrug antibody testing. Although this is unusual, it illustrates the flexibility of the fields ISTEST, ISBDAGNT, and ISTSTOPO to incorporate multiple options. Row 1: Shows the presence of ADA against the active metabolite of peginterferon beta-1a, active interferon beta 1a, in subject ABC-007. Rows 2-3: Show the screening and confirmation of ADA against the PEG epitope of peginterferon beta-1a in subject ABC-007.

Example 5 This example illustrates how to represent both study vaccine-induced humoral (antibody) immunity, and immunogenicity responses not related to the study vaccine but which are also important for collection, specifically in vaccine trials. In this case, the subject was administered with a human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and his protective antibody production against the major component of the study vaccine, RSV-protein B, was assessed. Detection and quantification of the anti-RSV-protein B antibody data from baseline to post-vaccination were collected and are represented below. At baseline, antibody against RSV-protein Z was detected

in the same subject, which suggests either natural infection by or previous vaccination with RSV-protein B at the time of assessment. Even though immunity against RSV-protein B was not the interest of the RSV vaccine study, immunological data pertaining to RSV-protein B was collected for the subject. This example illustrates the use of the CDISC-recommended ISCAT values "STUDY VACCINE-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY" and "NON-STUDY-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY" to distinguish between study vaccine-induced immunogenicity and immunogenicity findings unrelated to the study vaccine data collected during a vaccine study. ISCAT = "NON-STUDY-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY" was developed to explicitly and purposefully indicate whether an observed immunity toward an antigen was not related to the study vaccine but rather was a result of natural infection or previous vaccination. Oftentimes, it is simply impossible to tell whether the antibody found in a subject is due to a natural infection or previous vaccination (or both)—yet this immunogenicity, unrelated to the study vaccine, is important for collection and assessment at the screening phase of the trial. In this example, immune responses against RSV-protein Z were measured during the study. Because protein Z is not inserted into the vaccine vector, any immune response detected toward protein Z was not related to the study vaccine, although important for assessment and collected per the study protocol. In order to show that RSV-protein Z-induced antibody production was unrelated to the immunity solicited by the study vaccine RSV-protein B (ISCAT = "STUDY VACCINE-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY"), the ISCAT for rows 3 and 4 is “NON-STUDY-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY” (note: protein Z and protein B are examples, refer to controlled terminology for standard terms associated with ISBDAGNT). Rows 1-2: Show the screening and quantification of microbial-induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against the RSV-protein B at baseline, prior to the administration of the study vaccine. ISBDAGNT="HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS-PROTEIN B" is the immunogenic target in the study vaccine that could potentially stimulate the production of antibodies. Note: ISCAT="STUDY VACCINE-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY", even though at this point the study vaccine has not been administered to the subject; this is done purposefully to enable the grouping of baseline and treatment measurements. Rows 3-4: Show the screening and quantification of microbial-induced IgG antibody against the RSV-protein Z at baseline. Note: Because RSV-protein Z is not the immunogenic target of interest in this vaccine study, ISCAT is populated with the value "NON-STUDY RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY". Rows 5-7: Show the titer of microbial-induced IgG antibody against the RSV-protein B, post-vaccination at visits 1, 2, and 3. These 3 records show the antibody titers had increased post-vaccination, presumably due to the stimulation from the RSV study vaccine. ISCAT is populated with the value "STUDY VACCINE-RELATED IMMUNOGENICITY". is.xpt

Thus far, all the IS tests illustrated are measurements of concentrations of a substance (e.g., antibody titer). However, some immunogenicity tests are actual counts of immune cells that secrete a particular substance. These tests are described by the combination of ISTEST (Immunogenicity Test or Examination Name) and ISMSCBCE (Molecule Secreted by Cells), where ISTEST identifies the type of cells that secrete a specific

substance (e.g., antibody-secreting cells, cytokine-secreting cells) and ISMSCBCE names the substance (e.g., IgG antibody, interferon-gamma). The following 2 examples introduce the IS domain-specific variable, ISMSCBCE, and illustrate its use with ISTEST to represent a complete immunological analyte of interest. Example 6 This example shows data about the assessment of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Traditional methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that monitor humoral immune responses after immunization or infection typically only quantify specific antibody titers in serum. These methods do not provide any information about the actual number and location of the immune cells that secrete antibodies or cytokines. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay is a method to detect and quantify analyte-secreting T or B cells. During ELISpot testing, a colored precipitate forms and appears as spots at the sites of analyte localization (analytes typically are cytokines or antibodies), with each individual spot representing an individual analyte-secreting cell. The spots can be counted with an automated ELISpot reader system or manually, using a stereomicroscope. This example shows how to represent the quantification of ASCs as the number of spots per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as determined by B-cell ELISpot from a vaccine trial. The IS domain-specific variable ISMSCBCE introduced in this example allows flexibility in data representation and post-coordination of the various secreted antibody types and their respective ASCs. This approach liberates the ISTEST variable from having to house precoordinated and thus hyperspecific values crafted based on secretion and cell types. Row 1: Shows the total number of IgG ASCs from a subject’s blood sample. In this case, ISTEST="Antibody-secreting Cells"; the entity secreted by the cells in ISTEST is represented by the variable ISMSCBCE (i.e. IGG antibody non-specific to any antigen). Row 2: Shows the number of H1-specific IgG ASCs from the same subject’s blood sample. In this case, ISTEST="Antibody-secreting Cells"; the entity secreted by the cells in ISTEST is in ISMSCBCE (i.e. IgG antibody specific to H1 antigen). Row 3: Shows the number of H3-specific IgG ASCs from the same subject’s blood sample. In this case, ISTEST="Antibody-secreting Cells"; the entity secreted by the cells in ISTEST is in ISMSCBCE (i.e. IgG antibody specific to H3 antigen). is.xpt

Example 7 This example shows data from the in vitro assessment and quantification of cytokine-secreting immune cells, expressed in number of spot-forming cells (SFC) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as determined by T-cell ELISpot from a vaccine trial. Through vaccination, it is expected that cytokine secretion in immune cells is boosted whenever immune cells encounter the same virus and/or the previously exposed viral antigens. By increasing this cytokine secretion, immune cells aid in the host defense and protection against (re-)infections. In vaccine trials, this can be measured by isolating immune cells (e.g., PBMCs) from subjects at multiple time points during the course of the trial and restimulating them with the virus or its viral antigens in vitro. In this example, PBMCs were isolated from a subject participating a vaccine study for RSV and restimulated in vitro with either a RSV-antigen or without a stimulating agent. At baseline (i.e., before vaccination), the RSV antigen-stimulated PBMCs produced minimal number of interferon gamma, as expressed in interferon gamma-secreting cells quantified in the number of SFC/10^6 PBMC (row 2), as compared to no stimulation (row 1). Three weeks after vaccination, RSV-antigen stimulated PBMCs (row 4) showed significant increase in the number of interferon-gamma secreting cells compared to no stimulation (row 3) or baseline values (rows 1 and 2). This suggests immunological memory of the immune cells after encountering the same microorganism or its antigens, and the switch of cell state from resting to active.

The next 2 examples show data from microneutralization and opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) assays, which are used to measure vaccine efficacy and immunoprotectivity. Example 8 In vaccine studies, microneutralization assays are commonly used in assays to quantify viral-specific neutralizing antibodies in a subject’s specimen that can block viral infection in vitro, and therefore provide a measure of vaccine efficacy. A neutralizing antibody is an antibody that binds to, blocks, and prevents non-self agents from infecting cells. When immunizing a subject with a vaccine, the hope is that the vaccine will induce antiviral and humoral-protective antibody responses in the subject; with an effective vaccine, the quantity of virus-specific antibodies that are able to block viral infection are increased. To test the efficacy of a vaccine, a microneutralization test is performed by adding a vaccinated subject's serum and the virus of study interest to cell cultures in vitro. If neutralizing antibodies are present in the subject's serum post-vaccination, those antibodies will bind to, block, and prevent the virus from infecting cells in the culture plates. The neutralization titer is the specific dilution of the antibody that blocks viral infection of the cells. The 50% neutralization titer (also known as NT50), in the context of microneutralization assays, is defined as the antiviral antibody titer that blocks 50% of viral infection of the cells. Note: Some users may represent the 50% neutralization titer as "IC50 titer" or other test descriptors. CDISC recommends mapping all such values in the ISTSTDTL variable. NHOID is populated with respiratory syncytial virus because this microorganism is the subject of the vaccine efficacy test. NHOID, defined by the Non-host Organism Identifiers (OI) domain, should be used to map microorganisms that have been either experimentally determined in the course of a study or are previously known (e.g., lab strains used as reference in the study). In other words, NHOID is used when the study subject is the microorganism, and when the microorganism is present in the testing sample. In vaccine efficacy studies, a subject’s post-immunization sera is often incubated with a microbial strain of interest, where the functional capacities of the vaccine-induced antibodies are measured through whether the antibodies can effectively stop (from infection), neutralize, and kill the study microorganism of interest, in vitro. Examples of such tests include microneutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, and opsonophagocytic-killing assays. These are tests that measure the direct effect of the antimicrobial antibodies on the microorganism; therefore, said microorganism is the study subject and should be mapped to NHOID. This example uses data from the same RSV vaccine study, where the subject is being vaccinated with a viral vector containing RSV. The subject is tested before (baseline) and after vaccination (visits 1 and 2) to investigate whether the anti-RSV antibodies present in the subject’s serum also have the ability to neutralize RSV infection in vitro.

Example 9 In vaccine trials, the OPK assay is used as a correlate for immunoprotectivity against antigens, by measuring the functional capacities of vaccine-induced antibodies. Typically, this test is performed by incubating a subject's post-immunization sera with the bacterial strain of interest, phagocytes, and complement proteins. If antibacterial, functional antibodies are present in the subject's serum, those antibodies will bind to the bacteria together with complement proteins. This subsequently targets the bacteria for opsonization, the ingestion and destruction of invading non-self agents by phagocytes. With vaccination, the quantity of bacterial-specific, functional antibodies are increased, leading to a decreased number of viable bacterial cells in the presence of phagocytes, functional antibodies, and complement. The assay read-out is expressed in by the opsonization index, which is calculated using linear interpolation of the serum dilution containing functional antibody killing the desired percentage (usually 50%) of the bacteria, using a specified algorithm. NHOID is populated with Staphylococcus aureus 04-02981 because this strain of S. aureus is the subject of the vaccine efficacy test. NHOID, defined by the Non-host Organism Identifiers (OI) domain, should be used to map microorganisms that have been either experimentally determined in the course of a study or are previously known (e.g., lab strains used as reference in the study). In other words, NHOID is used when the study subject is the microorganism, and when the microorganism is present in the testing sample. In vaccine efficacy studies, a subject’s post-immunization sera is often incubated with a microbial strain of interest, where the functional capacities of the vaccine-induced antibodies are measured through whether the antibodies can effectively stop (from infection), neutralize, and kill the study microorganism of interest, in vitro. Examples of such tests include microneutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, and opsonophagocytic-killing assays. These are tests that measure the direct effect of the antimicrobial antibodies on the microorganism; therefore, said microorganism is the study subject and should be mapped to NHOID. In this vaccine-study example, the subject is vaccinated with a vector containing S. aureus-epitope X (note: epitope X is an example, refer to controlled terminology for standard terms associated with ISBDAGNT). The subject is tested before (baseline) and after vaccination (visits 1 and 2) to investigate whether the vaccine-induced functional antibodies drive efficient complement deposition and subsequent opsonophagocytic killing of S. aureus, in vitro. The assay read-out is expressed by the opsonization index (ISTSTDTL), which is a unit-less test. is.xpt

Example 10 This example shows how to present data from an autoimmune disease study, specifically how to represent information from disease-specific autoantibody tests. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth. Diagnosis of SS is generally based on the detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), that is, anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. Rows 1-5: Show the screening (row 1) and quantification (rows 2, 4) of ANAs. Rows 2 and 3 are grouped together using ISGRPID="1a"; this means the titer result in row 2 is specifically related to the particular nuclear staining pattern (i.e., speckled) finding in row 3. The speckled pattern of ANA is typically indicative of SS, systemic lupus, and mixed connective tissue disease. Rows 4 and 5 are grouped together using ISGRPID="1b"; this means the titer result in row 4 is specifically related to the nuclear staining pattern (i.e., nucleoar) finding in row 5. Rows 1 to 5 are grouped together using ISGRPID with values starting with the number "1", indicating that these records are related. The antinuclear antibodies test is post-coordinated and represented by both ISTEST="Autoantibody" and ISBDAGNT="NUCLEAR AUTOANTIGENS". Rows 6-11: Show the screening and quantification of the various SS-specific autoantibodies. SS autoantigens are represented by the ISBDAGNT variable, whereas the ISTEST="Autoantibody". is.xpt

Example 11 This example shows how to represent data from various allergy tests, specifically data from a mixed animal allergens test. Row 1: Shows the detection of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody against multiple animal allergens. ISBDAGNT is used to house the generic but controlled value "ANIMAL MIX ANTIGENS, MULTIPLE". Rows 2-3: Show the amount of IgE antibody against dog dander and its RAST classification score. Rows 4-5: Show the amount of IgE antibody against cat dander and its RAST classification score. Rows 6-7: Show the amount of IgE antibody against horse dander and its RAST classification score. Rows 8-9: Show the amount of IgE antibody against cow dander and its RAST classification score.

| LBTSTCND | Test Condition | Char | (TESTCOND) | Variable<br>Qualifier | Identifies any planned condition imposed by the assay system on the specimen at the time the test is | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | performed. |  |
| LBBDAGNT | Binding Agent | Char |  | Variable<br>Qualifier | The textual description of the agent that is binding to the entity in the LBTEST variable. The LBBDAGNT | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | variable is used to indicate that there is a binding relationship between the entities in the LBTEST and |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | LBBDAGNT variables, regardless of direction. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | LBBDAGNT is not a method qualifier. It should only be used when the actual interest of the measurement is |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | the binding interaction between the 2 entities in LBTEST and LBBDAGNT. In other words, the combination |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | of LBTEST and LBBDAGNT should describe the thing, the entity, or the analyte being measured, without the |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | need for additional variables. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | The binding agent may be (but is not limited to) a test article, a portion of the test article, a related |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | compound, or an endogenous molecule. |  |

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. LB – Assumptions
1. This domain captures laboratory data collected on the CRF or received from a central provider or vendor.
2. For lab tests that do not have continuous numeric results (e.g., urine protein as measured by dipstick, descriptive tests such as urine color), LBSTNRC
could be populated either with normal range values that are a range of character values for an ordinal scale (e.g., “NEGATIVE to TRACE") or a delimited set of values that are considered to be normal (e.g., “YELLOW”, “AMBER”). LBORNRLO, LBORNRHI, LBSTNRLO, and LBSTNRHI should be null for these types of tests.
3. LBNRIND can be added to indicate where a result falls with respect to reference range defined by LBORNRLO and LBORNRHI. Examples: "HIGH",
"LOW". If toxicity grading is available, values would be represented in the variables LBTOX and LBTOXGR. Clinical significance would be represented as described in Section 4.5.5, Clinical Significance for Findings Observation Class Data, in LBCLSIG (see also LB Example 1).
4. For lab tests where the specimen is collected over time (e.g., 24-hour urine collection), the start date/time of the collection goes into LBDTC and the end
date/time of collection goes into LBENDTC. See Section 4.4.8, Date and Time Reported in a Domain Based on Findings.
5. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the LB domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --BODSYS, --SEV.
6. A value derived by a central lab according to its procedures is considered collected rather than derived. See Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for
Variables.
7. The variable LBORRESU uses the UNIT codelist. This means that sponsors should be submitting a term from the CDISC Submission Value column in
the published Controlled Terminology List that is maintained for CDISC by NCI EVS. When sponsors have units that are not in this column, they should first check to see if their unit is mathematically synonymous with an existing/published unit from the UNIT codelist and submit their lab values using the published CDISC submission value. Example: "g/L" and "mg/mL" are mathematically synonymous, but only "g/L" is the submission value in

| LBTPTNUM | Planned Time Point<br>Number | Num |  | Timing | Numerical version of LBTPT to aid in sorting. | Perm |
| LBELTM | Planned Elapsed<br>Time from Time<br>Point Ref | Char | ISO 8601 duration | Timing | Planned elapsed time (in ISO 8601) relative to a planned fixed reference (LBTPTREF). This variable is | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | useful where there are repetitive measures. Not a clock time or a date/time variable. Represented as ISO |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | 8601 duration. Examples: "-PT15M" to represent the period of 15 minutes prior to the reference point |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | LBTPTREF. |  |
| LBTPTREF | Time Point<br>Reference | Char |  | Timing | Name of the fixed reference point referred to by LBELTM, LBTPTNUM, and LBTPT. Examples: "PREVIOUS | Perm |

| LBPTFL | Point in Time Flag | Char | (NY) | Timing | An indication that the specimen was collected at a single point in time. The value is "Y" or null. The intent of | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | this variable in the LB domain is to aid mapping to LOINC codes in the dataset, when LOINC part "Time |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | Aspect" = "Pt". |  |

the CDISC Unit codelist. If this is not the case, the unit must be added as a codelist extensible value in the Define.xml, and a new-term request must be submitted. a. CDISC Controlled Terminology Rules for Lab and Unit are available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
8. The LBLOINC variable contains a code from the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) database that identifies a specific
laboratory test. The LOINC to LB Mapping Codetable, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology, may be used to identify appropriate CDISC CT values for a test with a particular LOINC code. In addition to LBTEST, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD, and LBORRESU, the aspects of a test that are associated with a LOINC code may be represented in the variables LBTPT, LBANMETH, LBPOS, LBLOC, LBFAST, LBTSTCND, LBBDAGNT, LBTSTOPO, LBRESSCL, LBRESTYP, LBCOLSRT, LBLLOD, LBPTFL, and LBPDUR. These additional variables are only required to be populated when necessary to provide a semantically meaningful distinction between records with different LBLOINC values. LB – Examples Example 1 This example illustrates the use of previously published LB domain variables and introduces several new variables that were added to SDTMv2.0, including LBTSTCND, LBRESSCL, LBRESTYP, LBCOLSRT, LBLLOD, LBTMTHSN, LBPTFL, and LBPDUR. These variables, in part, aid in harmonization to LOINC. Row 1: Shows a value collected in 1 unit, but converted to selected standard unit. See Section 4.5.1, Original and Standardized Results of Findings and Tests Not Done, for additional examples for the population of result qualifiers. The result was evaluated by the investigator and determined to be not clinically significant. Rows 2-3: Show 2 records for alkaline phosphatase done at the same visit, a day apart. LBPTFL is set to "Y" for both rows because each result is based on a sample from a single point in time. Rows 4-5: Show 2 derived records (mean of records 2 and 3 and maximum value of records 2 and 3) grouped by a common LBGRPID value. The derived result in row 4 is described as a mean (LBCOLSRT="MEAN, ARITHMETIC"), but LBDRVFL is missing because the mean result was provided by the vendor. The derived result in row 5 was derived by the sponsor, and so is flagged as derived (LBDRVFL="Y"); LBCOLSRT is not populated because the result is not a collected summary result. For both derived results, the sponsor chose to populate LBRESSCL, LBRESTYP, LBSPEC, and LBFAST consistent with the 2 individual alkaline phosphatase records but did not populate LBLOINC or LBPTFL because neither derived record represented a single point in time. The sponsor chose to populate LBDTC with the first of the 2 specimen collection dates. Row 6: Shows use of LBTMTHSN to represent "HIGH SENSITIVITY" for the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test. Rows 7, 10: Show use of LBTSTCND. For the cryoglobulin test, 1-day cold incubation is noted; for the platelet aggregation test, collagen induced is noted. Row 8: Shows use of LBLLOD for a prostate-specific antigen test. Row 9: Shows use of LBPDUR to represent the planned duration of "PT24H" for collection of urine samples for the protein test. LBPTFL is set to missing because this test was not conducted at a single point in time. Rows 12-13: Show a suggested use of the LBSCAT variable. LBSCAT could be used to further classify types of tests within a laboratory panel (e.g., "DIFFERENTIAL"). The LYMLE result was evaluated by the investigator and determined to be not clinically significant. Row 15: Shows the proper use of the LBSTAT variable to indicate "NOT DONE", where a reason was collected when a test was not done. LBRESSCL, LBRESTYP, LBLOINC, LBSPEC, LBMETHOD, and LBPTFL are populated to describe the properties of the test that was not done.

Row 16: Shows measuring of the subject's cholesterol. The normal range for this test is <200 mg/dL. Note that although in this example the sponsor has decided to make LBSTNRHI="199", other sponsors may choose a different value. Row 17: Shows use of LBPTFL set to "Y" to indicate that the test used a sample taken at a single point in time. Row 18: Shows use of LBSTNRC for urine protein that is not reported as a continuous numeric result. The result was evaluated by the investigator and determined to be not clinically significant. lb.xpt Row STUDYID DOMAIN USUBJID LBSEQ LBGRPID LBTESTCD LBTEST LBTSTCND LBCAT LBSCAT LBORRES LBORRESU LBRESSCL LBRESTYP LBCOLSRT LBORNRLO LBORNRHI LBLLOD LBSTRESC LBSTRESN LBSTRESU LBSTNRLO LBSTNRHI LBSTNRC LBNRIND LBSTAT LBREASND LBLOINC LBSPEC LBMETHOD LBTMTHSN LBLOBXFL LBFAST LBDRVFL LBCLSIG VISITNUM VISIT LBDTC LBPTFL LBPDUR

Example 2 This example illustrates the use of timing variables for pre- and post-dose timed urine collections. Row 1: Shows an example of a pre-dose urine collection interval (from 4 hours prior to dosing until 15 minutes prior to dosing) with a negative value for LBELTM that reflects the end of the interval in reference to the fixed reference LBTPTREF, the date of which is recorded in LBRFTDTC. Rows 2-3: Show an example of post-dose urine collection intervals with values for LBELTM that reflect the end of the intervals in reference to the fixed reference LBTPTREF, the date of which is recorded in LBRFTDTC. lb.xpt

Example 3 This example illustrates the use of LBSTAT and LBREASND when there is no data value reported in LBORRES. Row 1: Shows a pregnancy test with an original result of “-” (negative sign) standardized to the text value “NEGATIVE” in LBSTRESC. Row 2: Shows a pregnancy test that was not performed because the subject was male.

Example 4 This example illustrates the use of the LBTSTOPO variable to identify the tests that screen, confirm, and quantify the presence of a substance. Row 1: Shows cannabinoids are screened. Row 2: Shows the previously detected cannabinoids are further confirmed in the subject. Row 3: Shows the quantification of the cannabinoids. lb.xpt

Example 5 This example illustrates the use of the LBBDAGNT variable for a single agent. Note: More complex use cases may require additional concepts for complete modeling. In this simple target engagement assessment, the target protein analytes interact with the binding agent. The use of the word "free" in the descriptions of rows 2 and 4 does not refer to the naturally occurring hepatocyte growth factor receptors or epidermal growth factor receptors, but rather to the receptors not bound to the binding agent. Representing the binding agent shows that what is being measured is the portion of the target receptors not bound to the binding agent, not the concentration of the receptors at their natural state. Row 1: Shows the total amount of HGFR, both soluble and bound, to the target "ABC-8675309". Row 2: Shows the amount of free HGFR not bound to the target "ABC-8675309" (i.e., a measure of the soluble analyte not bound to the target). Row 3: Shows the total amount of EGFR, both soluble and bound, to the target "ABC-8675309". Row 4: Shows the amount of free EGFR not bound to the target "ABC-8675309" (i.e., a measure of the soluble analyte not bound to the target). lb.xpt

6.3.5.7 Microbiology Domains
The microbiology domains include Microbiology Specimen (MB) and Microbiology Susceptibility (MS). The MB domain is used for the detection, identification, quantification, and other characterizations of microorganisms in subject samples, except for drug susceptibility testing. MS is used for representing data from drug-susceptibility testing on the organisms identified in MB. All non-host infectious organisms— including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites—are appropriate for the microbiology domains.
6.3.5.7.1 Microbiology Specimen (MB)
MB – Description/Overview A findings domain that represents non-host organisms identified including bacteria, viruses, parasites, protozoa and fungi.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. MB – Assumptions
1. Representation of findings in the Microbiology Specimen domain should be handled as follows:
a. In cases of tests that target an organism, group of organisms, or antigen for identification, MBTEST equals the name of the organism/antigen targeted by the identification assay, and i. MBTSTDTL should be “DETECTION”. ii. The result should generally be "PRESENT"/"ABSENT", "POSITIVE"/"NEGATIVE", or "INDETERMINATE". However, there may be cases where a test differentiates between 2 or more similar organisms, in which case it would be appropriate for the result to be the name of the organism detected. For example, a test may look for influenza A or influenza B antigen. In this case, MBTEST would be "Influenza A/B Antigen"; the result could be "INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN", "INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN", or "INFLUENZA A/B ANTIGEN". b. For non-targeted identification of organisms (i.e., tests that have the ability to identify a range of organisms without specifically targeting any), the value for MBTESTCD/MBTEST should be "MCORGIDN"/"Microbial Organism Identification", and the result should be the name of the organism or group of organisms found to be present (e.g., "INFLUENZA A VIRUS SUBTYPE H1N1"; "CLONORCHIS SINENSIS"). In this scenario MBORRES is populated with values from the Microorganism Codelist (C85491). c. Culture characteristics covers concepts such as growth/no growth, colony quantification measures, colony color, colony morphology, and so on. Note that this does not include drug susceptibility testing, which is represented in the Microbiology Susceptibility (MS) domain. i. MBTESTCD/MBTEST should be the name of the organism or group of organisms being characterized. ii. MBTSTDTL should be the name of the characteristic being described (e.g., “COLONY COUNT", "VIRAL LOAD"). iii. MBGRPID should be used to group characteristic records with the identification record of the organism to which the characteristics apply. iv. CDISC Controlled Terminology Rules for Microbiology (MB/MS) domains are available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
2. MBDTC represents the date the specimen was collected.

3. If the specimen was cultured, the start and end date of culture are represented in the Biospecimen Events (BE) domain in BESTDTC and BEENDTC
respectively. The variable --REFID represents the sample ID as originally assigned in the BE domain. See BE domain assumptions in the SDTMIG v3.4, section 6.2.2, for guidelines on assigning --REFID values to samples and subsamples. a. Culture dates can be connected to the MB record via MBREFID and BEREFID. b. If the same sample is associated with many biospecimen events and tests, users may need to make use of additional linking variables such as -- LNKID.
4. The variable NHOID is not allowed for use in the MB domain. Any additional Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class
qualifiers may be added to the MB domain, but the following variables would not generally be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --FAST, --TOX, -- TOXGR, --SEV.
6.3.5.7.2 Microbiology Susceptibility (MS)
MS – Description/Overview A findings domain that represents drug susceptibility testing results only. This includes phenotypic testing (where drug is added directly to a culture of organisms) and genotypic tests that provide results in terms of susceptible or resistant. Drug susceptibility testing may occur on a wide variety of non-host organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and parasites.

|  |  |  |  |  | vertical to a horizontal format. The value in MSTESTCD cannot be longer than 8 characters, nor can it |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | start with a number (e.g., "1TEST" is not valid). MSTESTCD cannot contain characters other than |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | letters, numbers, or underscores. Examples: "MIC" for Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | "MICROSUS" for Microbial Susceptibility. |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | or "RESISTANT". However, results from some susceptibility tests may report only a categorical result |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | and not a numeric result. Thus, in order for susceptibility results to be represented consistently, |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | MSRESCAT should no longer be used for this purpose. In this version, the core designation has been |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | changed from Expected to Permissible. |  |
| MSSTAT | Completion Status | Char | (ND) | Record<br>Qualifier | Used to indicate that a question was not asked or a test was not done, or a test was attempted but did | Perm |

1. Microbiology Susceptibility testing includes testing of the following types:
a. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (qualitative), which may involve determining susceptibility/resistance (qualitative) at a predefined concentration of drug, or determining a specific dose (quantitative) at which a drug inhibits organism growth or some other process associated with virulence. i. For studies using qualitative testing methods, MSAGENT, MSCONC, and MSCONCU are used to represent the predefined drug, concentration, and units, respectively. Results are represented with values such as “SUSCEPTIBLE” or “RESISTANT”. ii. For studies using quantitative testing methods, MSAGENT is used to represent the drug being tested; MSCONC and MSCONCU are not used. The concentration at which growth is inhibited is the result in these cases (MSORRES, MSSTRESC/MSSTRESN), with units being represented in MSORRESU/MSSTRESU. b. Genetic tests that provide results in terms of susceptible/resistant only (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)). Genotypic tests that provide results in terms of specific changes to nucleotides, codons, or amino acids of genes/gene products associated with resistance should be represented in the Genomic Findings (GF) domain, as that domain structure contains the variables necessary to accommodate data of this type. If a test provides both mutation data and susceptibility data, the mutation results should be represented in GF and the susceptibility information should be represented in MS. In these cases, the GF records should be linked via RELREC to susceptibility records in MS.

i. As in 1.a.ii, MSAGENT should be populated with the drug whose action would be affected by the genetic marker being assessed via the genotypic test. MSCONC and MSCONCU are null in these records. c. CDISC Controlled Terminology Rules for Microbiology (MB/MS) domains are available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
2. MSDTC represents the date the specimen was collected.
3. If the specimen was cultured, the start and end date of culture are represented in the Biospecimen Events (BE) domain in BESTDTC and BEENDTC,
respectively. --REFID represents the sample ID as originally assigned in the BE domain. See BE domain assumptions in the SDTMIG v3.4, Section 6.2.2, for guidelines on assigning --REFID values to samples and subsamples. a. Culture dates can be connected to the MS record via MSREFID and BEREFID. b. If the same sample is associated with many biospecimen events and tests, users may need to make use of additional linking variables such as -- LNKID.
4. NHOID is a sponsor-defined, intuitive name of the non-host organism being tested. It should only populated with values representing what is known
about the identity of the organism before the results of the test are determined. It should therefore never be used as a qualifier of result.
5. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the MS domain, but the following variables would
not generally be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --TOX, --TOXGR --SEV.
6.3.5.7.3 Microbiology Specimen/Microbiology Susceptibility Examples
Example 1 In this example, both a central and a local lab (MBNAM) independently identified Enterococcus faecalis (MBORRES) in a fluid specimen (MBSPEC) taken from the skin (MBLOC) of a subject at visit 1. The method used by both labs was a solid microbial culture (MBMETHOD). Because the culture was not targeted to encourage the growth of a specific organism, MBTESTCD/MBTEST = "MCORGIDN"/"Microbial Organism Identification" and MBORRES represents the name of the organism identified. mb.xpt

After E. faecalis was identified in the subject sample, drug susceptibility testing was performed at each of the labs using both the sponsor's investigational drug and amoxicillin. Because an identified organism is the subject of the test, the NHOID variable is populated with "ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS". Between the
2 labs (MSNAM), a total of 3 susceptibility testing methods were used: epsilometer, disk diffusion, and macro broth dilution (MSMETHOD). Epsilometer and
disk diffusion both use agar diffusion methods, in which an agar plate is inoculated with the microorganism of interest and either a strip (epsilometer) or discs (disk diffusion) containing various concentrations of the drug are placed on the agar plate. The epsilometer test method provides both a minimum inhibitory concentration (MSTESTCD = "MIC"), the lowest concentration of a drug that inhibits the growth of a microorganism, and a qualitative interpretation (MSTESTCD = "MICROSUS") such as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. The disk diffusion test method provides the diameter of the zone of inhibition

(MSTESTCD = "DIAZOINH") and a qualitative interpretation such as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant (MSTESTCD = " MICROSUS" ). The quantitative and qualitative results are grouped together using MSGRPID. The third method, macro broth dilution, was used to test the specimen at a predefined drug concentration of each of the drugs. When the drug and amount are a predefined part of the test, the variable MSAGENT is populated with the name of the drug being used in the susceptibility test. The variables MSCONC and MSCONCU represent the concentration and units of the drug being used. Rows 1-4: Show the minimum inhibitory concentration and the interpretation result reported from Central Lab ABC from a sample that was tested for susceptibility to the sponsor drug and amoxicillin, using an epsilometer test method. Rows 5-6: Show that Local Lab XYZ found that the sample was susceptible to the sponsor drug at a concentration of 0.5 ug/dL and resistant to amoxicillin at a concentration of 0.5 ug/dL. Rows 7-10: Show the diameter of the zone of inhibition and the interpretation result reported from Local Lab XYZ from a sample that was tested for susceptibility to the sponsor drug and amoxicillin using a disk diffusion test method. ms.xpt

Example 2 In this example, a sputum sample, collected from the subject at 3 visits over the course of 15 days, was tested for the presence of infectious organisms. The 2 organisms identified were also tested for susceptibility to both penicillin and the sponsor's study drug (MSAGENT). The example shows that the 2 infecting organisms were cleared over the course of the 3 visits. Specimen collection was represented in the Biospecimen Events (BE) domain. be.xpt

Rows 1-2: Show that the sponsor drug (MSAGENT) was tested against "STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE" (NHOID) from subject sample SP01 and that the drug has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MSTESTCD/MSTEST) of 0.004 mg/L (row 1). This led to the conclusion that this organism is susceptible to that drug (row 2). Rows 3-4: Show that penicillin was tested against the same organism from the same sample and was found to have a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.023 mg/L (row 3). This led to the conclusion that "STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE" is resistant to penicillin (row 4). Rows 5-8: Similar to rows 1-4, the sponsor drug (rows 5-6) and penicillin (rows 7-8) were tested against " KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE" from an additional sample from the same subject at a later time point. Results from these tests indicated that the organism was susceptible to sponsor drug, yet had intermediate resistance to penicillin. Rows 9-10: A test against "KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE" from an additional sample at a later time point showed little change in the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin, and that the organism was still classified as having intermediate resistance to this drug. ms.xpt

Example 3 This example shows the microorganisms detected from a gastric aspirate specimen from a child with suspected tuberculosis (TB). In this example, gastric lavage is only performed once. Three records in the MB domain store detection records for 2 levels of detection: acid-fast bacilli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Characteristics from a culture on solid media that support the presumptive detection of Mtb are also represented in MB. The susceptibility results from both the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and the solid culture are represented in the MS domain. Specimen processing events included sample collection, preparation, and culturing; these events are represented in the BE domain. For TB studies, each sample needs a separate identifier to link it to further actions or characteristics of the sample. Therefore, each aliquot is assigned a unique BEREFID value that can be traced to the BEREFID value assigned to the collected "parent" sample. BEREFID is also used to connect the BE and Biospecimen Findings (BS) domains (via BSREFID), as well as any results obtained from the sample that are in the MB or MS domains (via MBREFID and MSREFID). If the same sample is used in many tests, the use of --REFID may result in a potentially undesirable many-to-many merge; users may need to make use of additional linking variables such as --LNKID and --LNKGRP. Information about the BE and BS domains including the specification tables, assumptions, and examples can be found in the Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.5.2 of this document. In the BE, BS, MB, and MS domains, --DTC represents the date of sample collection. --LNKID and --LNKGRP are used to link culture start and stop dates (BE) with culture results (MB and MS). Row 1: Shows the event of specimen collection. This is the genesis of the sample identified by BEREFID="100"; therefore, BEDTC and BESTDTC are the same. The specimen collection setting, collection method, and specimen type are represented using supplemental qualifiers. Even though the variable Specimen Type is available for use in Findings domains, it is not available for use in Events domains and thus it is represented as supplemental qualifier.

Rows 2-6: Show that the sample was aliquoted (i.e., smaller subsamples were portioned out from the parent sample) and each separate aliquot assigned a unique BEREFID. In such cases, BEREFID is an incremented decimal value with the original sample's BEREFID (when BECAT="COLLECTION") as the base number. (This is not an explicit requirement, but makes tracking the samples easier.) The definitive link between parent-child samples is defined by the PARENT variable shown in the RELSPEC dataset. Rows 7-9: Show that 3 of the aliquots (100.3, 100.4, and 100.5) were cultured for detection (row 7) and tested for drug susceptibility (rows 8 and 9). The inoculation and read dates of a culture should be represented in BESTDTC and BEENDTC, respectively. These dates can be linked to the culture results in MB and MS using BELNKID, MBLNKGRP, and MSLNKID. Row 10: Shows that sample 100.1 was concentrated. be.xpt

The RELSPEC table shows the relationship of the parent sample to its aliquots. The LEVEL variable indicates that the sample has been subsampled. The original parent sample is always LEVEL="1". An aliquot of the sample would be LEVEL="2". If the aliquot was further split, that subsample would be LEVEL="3". Row 1: Shows the original collected (parent) sample. The PARENT variable is left blank to indicate that this is the highest level sample. Rows 2-6: Show the relationship of each aliquot in the BE domain to the parent sample. PARENT is populated with the REFID value of the parent sample, indicating that the sample with REFID="100" is the parent of these samples. LEVEL="2" indicates that these aliquots are subsamples of the original (LEVEL="1") sample. relspec.xpt

Results from detection tests performed on samples are represented in the MB domain. The sputum sample was aliquoted 5 times. Three of these aliquots underwent detection testing using 3 separate tests: 1 for acid-fast bacillus (AFB), 1 for M. tuberculosis complex, and 1 for M. tuberculosis. MBTESTCD/MBTEST represents the organism being investigated, MBMETHOD represents the testing method, and MBREFID represents which aliquot was tested. The variable MBTSTDTL is used to provide further description of the test performed in producing the MB result. In addition to detection, MBTSTDTL can be used to represent specific attributes (e.g., quantifiable and semi-quantifiable results of the culture) as well as qualitative details about the culture (e.g., colony color, morphology). Row 1: Shows a test targeting the presence or absence of AFB using a stain. The MBSPCCND shows that the sample used in the test was concentrated. MBGRPID can be used to connect the detection record with the corresponding AFB quantification results shown in row 2. Row 2: Shows a categorical result for an AFB test using a stain. MBORRES contains a result based on a CDC AFB quantification scale. The name of the scale used is represented as a supplemental qualifier. MBREFID indicates which aliquot the procedure was performed upon and MBGRPID is used to connect the AFB quantification record to the detection record in row 1. Row 3: Shows a test targeting the presence or absence of M. tuberculosis complex using a genotyping method. Details about the assay can be found in the Device Identifiers (DI) domain. The value in SPDEVID links the genotype result to the assay information in the DI domain. The microbial detection certainty is represented as a supplemental qualifier. Because genotyping was used, the detection is considered to be definitive. Row 4: Shows a test targeting the presence or absence of M. tuberculosis performed on a solid culture. The medium type and microbial detection certainty are represented as supplemental qualifier. Because genotyping was not used, the detection is considered to be presumptive. The culture start and stop dates are represented in BE and are connected to the culture results via BELNKID and MBLNKGRP. MBGRPID is used to connect the detection record in MB with the corresponding culture characteristics shown in rows 5-7. Row 5: Shows a colony-forming unit (CFU) count from a solid culture. The MBORRES value represents the actual colony count from this plate. However, the sample that was spread on this plate represented a 100-fold dilution from the original subject sample. This information is represented in the Dilution Factor supplemental qualifier (MBDILFCT), whose value = 10^-2 (1/100th). In order to enable more straightforward pooling of CFU data, a simple integer result (14700) is used in MBSTRESC/N, and MBSTRESU="CFU/mL". The medium type for the solid culture is also represented as a supplemental qualifier.

Results from drug susceptibility tests performed on samples are represented in the MS domain. This includes all phenotypic tests (where the drug is added directly to the culture medium) and genotypic tests (when the result is given as susceptible or resistant). Genotypic tests that give results of specific genetic polymorphisms should be represented in the Pharmacogenomics/Genetics Findings (PF) domain, even though such results may be categorized as susceptible or resistant. In this example, the variable NHOID (Non-host Organism Identifier) is populated with the name of the organism that is the subject of the test. Rows 1-2: Show phenotypic testing results on 2 separate culture plates: 1 with medium containing rifampicin (row 1) and 1 with medium containing isoniazid (row 2). MSAGENT is populated with the name of the drug being used in the susceptibility test. The variables MSCONC and MSCONCU represent the concentration and units of the drug being used. The culture start and stop dates are represented in BE and can be linked to MS by BELNKID and MSLNKID. Rows 3-4: Show genotypic susceptibility testing results on the same aliquot from a NAAT that looks for mutations that confer resistance to 2 drugs. MSAGENT should be populated with the name of the drug whose action is affected by the mutation being tested for. However, because the drug is not used in the test, MSCONC and MSCONU should be null. These results are represented in MS because the only result given is in terms of resistant/susceptible; no genetic results are reported. ms.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. MI – Assumptions
1. This domain holds findings resulting from the microscopic examination of tissue samples. These examinations are performed on a specimen, usually
one that has been prepared with some type of stain. Some examinations of cells in fluid specimens (e.g., blood, urine) are classified as lab tests and should be stored in the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain. Biomarkers assessed by histologic or histopathological examination (by employing cytochemical/immunocytochemical stains) are stored in the MI domain.
2. When biomarker results are represented in MI, MITESTCD reflects the biomarker of interest (e.g., "BRCA1", "HER2", "TTF1"), and MITSTDTL
further qualifies the record. MITSTDTL is used to represent details descriptive of staining results (e.g., "H SCORE TOTAL SCORE", "STAINING INTENSITY", "PERCENT POSITIVE CELL").
3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the MI domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --POS, --MODIFY, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --LEAD, --CSTATE, --BLFL, -- FAST, --DRVFL, --LLOQ, --ULOQ.

MI – Examples Example 1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a method that involves treating tissue with a stain that adheres to very specific substances. IHC is the method most commonly used to assess the amount of HER2 receptor protein on the surface of the cancer cells. A cell with too many receptors receives too many growth signals. In this study, IHC assessment of HER2 in samples of breast cancer tissue yielded staining intensity on a scale of 0 to 3+. Staining intensity values of 0 to 1+ were categorized as negative; values of 2+ and 3+ were categorized as positive. Row 1: Shows a subject with a receptor protein stain intensity value of "0", categorized in MIRESCAT as "NEGATIVE". Row 2: Shows a subject with a receptor protein stain intensity value of "2+", categorized in MIRESCAT as "POSITIVE". mi.xpt

Example 2 In this study, IHC for estrogen receptor protein expression in a tissue was reported using the Allred scoring system. The proportion positive score was assessed as the percentage of tumor cells that stained positive on a scale from 0 to 5. Staining intensity was assessed as none, weak, intermediate, or strong, and scored from
0 to 3, respectively. The total score is the sum of the proportion positive and stain intensity scores.
Row 1: Shows the Allred proportion positive score. Row 2: Shows the staining intensity, which was assessed as "Strong". The score associated with an intensity of "STRONG" is in MISTRESC and MISTRESN. Row 3: The total score is a represented in a derived record, so MIORRES is null. mi.xpt

Example 3 In this study, IHC staining for NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1; also known as thyroid transcription factor 1) was reported at a detailed level. Staining intensity of individual cells was assessed on a semi-quantitative scale ranging from 0 to 3+, and the percentage of tumor cells at each staining intensity level was reported. These results were used to calculate the H-score, which ranges from 0 to 300. Rows 1-4: Show the percentage of cells at each H-Score staining intensity.

Example 1 This example shows concentration data for drug A and a metabolite of drug A from plasma and from urine samples collected pre-dose and after dosing on study days 1 and 11. PCTPTREF is a text value of the description of a “zero” time (e.g., time of dosing). It should be meaningful. If there are multiple PK profiles being generated, the zero time for each will be different (e.g., a different dose such as first dose, second dose) and, as a result, values for PCTPTREF must be different. In this example, such values for PCTPTREF are required to make values of PCTPTNUM and PCTPT unique (see Section 4.4.10, Representing Time Points). Rows 1-2: Show day 1 pre-dose drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma and urine. Rows 3-4: Show day 1 pre-dose drug and metabolite concentrations in urine. Urine specimens may be collected over an interval; both PCDTC and PCENDTC have been populated with the same value to indicate that these specimens were collected at a point in time rather than over an interval. Rows 5-6: Show specimen properties (VOLUME and PH) for the day 1 pre-dose urine specimens. These have a PCCAT value of "SPECIMEN PROPERTY". Rows 7-12: Show day 1 post-dose drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Rows 13-16: Show day 11 drug and metabolite concentrations in plasma. Rows 17-20: Show day 11 drug and metabolite concentrations in urine specimens collected over an interval. The elapsed times for urine samples are calculated as the elapsed time (from the reference time point, PCTPTREF) to the end of the specimen collection interval. Elapsed time values that are the same for urine and plasma samples have been assigned the same value for PCTPT. For the urine samples, the value in PCEVLINT describes the planned evaluation (or collection) interval relative to the time point. The actual evaluation interval can be determined by subtracting PCDTC from PCENDTC. Rows 21-30: Show additional drug and metabolite concentrations and specimen properties related to the day 11 dose. pc.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. PP – Assumptions
1. Pharmacokinetics Parameters is a derived dataset, and may be produced from an analysis dataset with a different structure. As a result, some sponsors may need to normalize their analysis dataset in order for
it to fit into the SDTM-based PP domain.
2. Information pertaining to all parameters (e.g., number of exponents, model weighting) should be submitted in the SUPPPP dataset.
3. There are separate codelists used for PPORRESU/PPSTRESU where the choice depends on whether the value of the pharmacokinetic parameter is normalized.
a. Codelist “PKUNIT” is used for non-normalized parameters. b. Codelists “PKUDMG” and “PKUDUG” are used when parameters are normalized by dose amount in milligrams or micrograms, respectively. c. Codelists “PKUWG” and “PKUWKG” are used when parameters are normalized by weight in grams or kilograms, respectively.

4. Multiple subset codelists were created for the unique unit expressions of the same concept across codelists. This approach allows study-context appropriate use of unit values for pharmacokinetics (PK)
analysis subtypes. Controlled Terminology Rules for PK are available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
5. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the PP domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: --BODSYS, --SEV.
PP – Examples Example 1 This example shows PK parameters calculated from time-concentration profiles for the parent drug and 1 metabolite in plasma and urine for one subject. Note that PPRFTDTC is populated in order to link the PP records to the respective PC records. In this example, PPSPEC is null for observed total clearance (PPTESTCD = "CLO") records because it is calculated from multiple specimen sources (i.e., plasma and urine). Rows 1-12: Show parameters for day 1. Rows 13-24: Show parameters for day 11. pp.xpt

Example 2 This example shows various AUCs calculated using sponsor-defined formulas or the linear-log trapezoidal method. Rows 1-3: Show the "AUC from T1 to T2" measurements for Drug Parent (row 1), Drug Metabolite 1 (row 2) and Drug Metabolite 2 (row 3). These parameters are calculated using the LIN-LOG TRAPEZOIDAL METHOD which is in PPANMETH. Row 4: Shows the "Ratio AUC" measurement of Drug Metabolite 1 to Drug Parent. Instead of pre-corrdinating "Ratio AUC of Drug Metabolite 1 to Drug Parent" all into the PPTEST, PPANMETH is used to describe the numerator (Drug Metabolite 1) and the denominator (Drug Parent) values that contribute to the Ratio AUC calculation in PPTEST. This post-coordination approach liberates the PPTEST variable from having to house hyper-specific, pre-coordinated PK parameter values.

6.3.5.9.3 Relating PP Records to PC Records
Sponsors must document the concentrations used to calculate each parameter. This may be done in analysis dataset metadata or by documenting relationships between records in the Pharmacokinetics Parameters (PP) and Pharmacokinetics Concentrations (PC) datasets in a RELREC dataset (see Section 8.2, Relating Peer Records, and Section 8.3, Relating Datasets). PC-PP – Relating Datasets If all time-point concentrations in PC are used to calculate all parameters for all subjects, then the relationship between the 2 datasets can be documented as shown in this table: relrec.xpt

Note that the reference time point and the analyte are part of the natural key (see Section 3.2.1.1, Primary Keys) for both datasets. In this relationship, --GRPID is a surrogate key, and must be populated so that each combination of analyte and reference time point has a separate value of --GRPID. PC-PP – Relating Records This section illustrates 4 methods for representing relationships between PC and PP records under 4 different circumstances. All these examples are based on the same PC and PP data for 1 drug (i.e., drug X). The different methods for representing relationships are based on which linking variables are used in RELREC.
• Method A (many to many, using PCGRPID and PPGRPID)
• Method B (one to many, using PCSEQ and PPGRPID)
• Method C (many to one, using PCGRPID and PPSEQ)

• Method D (one to one, using PCSEQ and PPSEQ)
The different examples illustrate situations in which different subsets of the pharmacokinetic concentration data were used in calculating the pharmacokinetic parameters. As in the example above, --GRPID values must take into account all the combinations of analytes and reference time points; both are part of the natural key for both datasets. For each example, PCGRPID and PPGRPID were used to group related records within each respective dataset. The exclusion of some concentration values from the calculation of some parameters affects the values of PCGRPID and PPGRPID for the different situations. To conserve space, the PC and PP domains appear only once, but with 4 --GRPID columns, 1 for each of the example situations. Note that a submission dataset would contain only 1 --GRPID column with a set of values such as those shown in 1 of the 4 columns in the PC and PP datasets.

Example 2 Only some records in PC were used to calculate all pharmacokinetic parameters; time points 8 and 9 on day 1 were not used for any pharmacokinetic parameters. This example uses --GRPID values in the PCGRPID (Example 2) and PPGRPID (Example 2) columns. Note that for the 2 excluded PC records, PCGRPID = "EXCLUDE"; for other PC records, PCGRPID = "DY1_DRGX". All pharmacokinetic concentrations for day 8 were used to calculate all pharmacokinetic parameters. Because day 8 relationships are the same as in Example 1, they are not included here. Method A (Many to Many, Using PCGRPID and PPGRPID) The relationship with RELID "1" includes PC records with PCGRPID = "DY1_DRGX" and all PP records with PPGRPID = "DY1DRGX". PC records with PCGRPID = "EXCLUDE" are not included in this relationship. relrec.xpt

Example 3 Only some records in PC were used to calculate some parameters; time points 8 and 9 on day 1 were not used for half-life calculations, but were used for other parameters. This example uses --GRPID values in the PCGRPID (Example 3) and PPGRPID (Example 3) columns. Note that the 2 excluded PC records have PCGRPID = "DY1_DRGX_B"; the other PC records have PCGRPID = "DY1_DRGX_A". Note also that the PP records for half-life calculations have PPGRPID = "DYDRGX_HALF", whereas the other PP records have PPGRPID = "DY1DRGX_A". All pharmacokinetic concentrations for day 8 were used to calculate all pharmacokinetic parameters. Because day 8 relationships are the same as in Example 1, they are not included here.

Example 4 Only some records in PC were used to calculate parameters; time point 5 was excluded from Tmax, time point 6 from Cmax, and time points 11 and 12 from AUC. This example uses --GRPID values in the PCGRPID (Example 4) and PPGRPID (Example 4) columns. Note that 4 values of PCGRPID and 4 values of PPGRPID were used. Because of the complexity of this example, only methods A and D are illustrated. Method A (Many to Many, Using PCGRPID and PPGRPID) Rows 1-4: The relationship with RELID "1" includes PC records with PCGRPID values "DY1DRGX_A", "DY1DRGX_C", and "DY1DRGX_D" and the one PP record with PPGRPID = "TMAX". Rows 5-8: The relationship with RELID "2" includes PC records with PCGRPID values "DY1DRGX_A", "DY1DRGX_B", and "DY1DRGX_D" and the one PP record with PPGRPID = "CMAX". Rows 9-12: The relationship with RELID "3" includes PC records with PCGRPID values "DY1DRGX_A", "DY1DRGX_B", and "DY1DRGX_C" and the one PP record with PPGRPID = "AUC". Rows 13-17: The relationship with RELID "4" includes PC records with PCGRPID values "DY1DRGX_A", "DY1DRGX_B", "DY1DRGX_C", and "DY1DRGX_D" (in this case, all PC records) and all PP records with PPGRPID = "OTHER". relrec.xpt

• Using PPSEQ values; use PCGRPID values wherever possible
• Using PPGRPID values wherever possible; use PCSEQ values

PC-PP Conclusions Relating the datasets (as described in Section 8, Representing Relationships and Data) is the simplest method; however, all time-point concentrations in PC must be used to calculate all parameters for all subjects. If datasets cannot be related, then individual subject records must be related. In either case, the values of PCGRPID and PPGRPID must take into account multiple analytes and multiple reference time points, if they exist. Method A is clearly the most efficient in terms of having the least number of RELREC records, but it does require the assignment of --GRPID values (which are optional) in both the PC and PP datasets. Method D, in contrast, does not require the assignment of --GRPID values, relying instead on the required --SEQ values in both datasets to relate the records. Although Method D results in the largest number of RELREC records compared to the other methods, it may be the easiest to implement consistently across the range of complexities shown in the examples. Two additional methods, methods B and C, are also shown for Examples 1-3. They represent hybrid approaches, using -- GRPID values in only 1 dataset (PP and PC, respectively) and --SEQ values for the other. These methods are best suited for sponsors who want to minimize the number of RELREC records while not having to assign --GRPID values in both domains. Methods B and C would not be ideal, however, if one expected complex scenarios as shown in Example 4. Note that an attempt has been made to approximate real pharmacokinetic data; however, the example values are not intended to reflect data used for actual analysis. When certain time-point concentrations have been omitted from PP calculations in Examples 2-4, the actual parameter values in the PP dataset have not been recalculated from those in Example 1 to reflect those omissions. PC-PP – Suggestions for Implementing RELREC in the Submission of PK Data Determine which of the scenarios best reflects how PP data are related to PC data. Questions that should be considered include:
1. Do all parameters for each PK profile use all concentrations for all subjects? If so, create a PPGRPID value
for all PP records and a PCGRPID value for all PC records for each profile for each subject, analyte, and reference time point. Decide whether to relate datasets or records. If choosing the latter, create records in RELREC for each PCGRPID value and each PPGRPID value (method A). Use RELID to show which PCGRPID and PPGRPID records are related. Consider RELREC methods B, C, and D as applicable.
2. Do all parameters use the same concentrations, although maybe not all of them (Example 2)? If so, create a
single PPGRPID value for all PP records, and 2 PCGRPID values for the PC records: a PCGRPID value for ones that were used and a PCGRPID value for those that were not used. Create records in RELREC for each PCGRPID value and each PPGRPID value (method A). Use RELID to show which PCGRPID and PPGRPID records are related. Consider RELREC methods B, C, and D as applicable.
3. Do any parameters use the same concentrations, but not as consistently as shown in Examples 1 and 2? If
so, refer to Example 3. Assign a GRPID value to the PP records that use the same concentrations. More than 1 PPGRPID value may be necessary. Assign as many PCGRPID values in the PC domain as needed to group these records. Create records in RELREC for each PCGRPID value and each PPGRPID value (method A). Use RELID to show which PCGRPID and PPGRPID records are related. Consider RELREC methods B, C, and D as applicable.
4. If none of the above applies, or the data become difficult to group, then start with Example 4, and decide
which RELREC method would be easiest to implement and represent.

6.3.6 Morphology (MO)
Domain Decommissioning Update The MO domain has been decommissioned as of SDTMIG v3.4. When the Morphology domain was introduced in SDTMIG v3.2, the SDS Team planned to represent morphology and physiology findings in separate domains: morphology findings in the MO domain and physiology findings in separate domains by body systems. Since then, the team found that separating morphology and physiology findings was more difficult than anticipated and provided little added value. This led to the decision to expand the body system-based domains to cover both morphology and physiology findings and to deprecate MO in a future version of the SDTMIG. Submissions using that later SDTMIG version would represent morphology results in the appropriate body system-based physiology/morphology domain. For data prepared using a version of the SDTMIG that includes both the MO domain and body system-based physiology/morphology domains, morphology findings may be represented in either the MO domain or in a body-system based physiology/morphology domain. Custom body system-based domains may be used if the appropriate body system-based domain is not included in the SDTMIG version being used.
6.3.7 Morphology/Physiology Domains
Individual domains for morphology and physiology findings about specific body systems are grouped together in this section. This grouping is not meant to imply that there is a single morphology/physiology domain. Additional domains for other body systems are expected to be added in future versions of the SDTMIG. The CDISC Controlled Terminology of SDTM domain abbreviations and the therapeutic area user guides may have examples of other body system domains that are not yet in the SDTMIG.
6.3.7.1 Generic Morphology/Physiology Specification
This section describes properties common to all the body system-based morphology/physiology domains.
• The SDTMIG includes several domains for physiology and morphology findings for different body
systems. These differ only in body system, in domain code, and in informative content such as examples.
• In the partial generic domain specification table, "--" is used as a placeholder. In each individual body
system-based morphology/physiology domain specification, this placeholder is replaced by the appropriate domain code.
• The variables included in the generic morphology/physiology domain specification table are those required
or expected in the individual body system-based morphology/physiology domains. Individual morphology/physiology domains may included additional expected variables. All other variables allowed in findings domains are allowed in the body system-based morphology/physiology domains
• All body system-based physiology/morphology domains share the same structure, provided here. Although
time point is not in the structure, it can be included in the structure of a particular domain if time point variables were included in the data represented.
• CDISC Controlled Terminology includes codelists for TEST and TESTCD values for each body-system
based domain.

MK – Assumptions
1. The Musculoskeletal System Findings domain should not be used for oncology data related to the musculoskeletal system (e.g., bone lesions). Such data
should be placed in the appropriate oncology domains: Tumor/Lesion Identification (TU), Tumor/Lesion Results (TR), and/or Disease Response and Clinical Classification (RS).
2. Musculoskeletal assessment examples that may have results represented in the MK domain include the following: morphology/physiology observations
(e.g., swollen/tender joint count, limb movement, strength/grip measurements).
3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the MK domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --LOINC, --TOX, --TOXGR, --FAST, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --ORREF, -- STREFC, --STREFN. MK – Examples Example 1 This example illustrates data collected for the swollen/tender joint count assessment, specifically the 68-joint count. After determining whether each joint is swollen or tender, the assessor will add up the number of "Yes" responses for swollen joints and tender joints to obtain a total count for each. Total counts were not collected on the CRF since they were to be derived in ADaM datasets. Data collection included a field for marking a joint not evaluable when that joint met a condition (e.g., infection of the overlying tissue or skin, grossly edematous, fused), which precluded joint assessment, as specified by the protocol and the protocol-related joint assessor training. A field for the reason that a joint was not evaluable was not needed. Note that there was a field for marking a joint assessment as not done; this was to be used if the joint assessor overlooked or missed a joint while performing the joint assessment. The data collected are represented in the MK domain. Each joint location is specified in MKLOC with laterality ("RIGHT" or "LEFT") in MKLAT. Because the evaluation includes a large number of joints that would result in many records, only a subset of the data collected is shown below. Rows 1-8, 11-12, 15-16: Show the occurrence of tenderness or swelling (MKORRES/MKSTRESC="Y", "N") at specific joint locations, represented in MKLOC, on the right and left sides (MKLAT) of the body. Rows 9-10: Show that the assessments for tenderness and swelling of the acromioclavicular joint (see MKLOC) on the right side of the body was not performed (MKSTAT="NOT DONE"), but a specific reason was not collected on the CRF. Rows 13-14: Show that the assessments for tenderness and swelling of the shoulder joint (see MKLOC) on the right side of the body was not performed (MKSTAT="NOT DONE") because it was not evaluable (MKREASND="JOINT NOT EVALUABLE").

Example 2 This example illustrates the collection of scores for the joint space-narrowing assessment. There are 2 scoring methods that may be used to evaluate the joints via a radiographic image: Sharp/Genant and Sharp/van der Heijde. In this evaluation of radiographs for joint narrowing, each joint was graded. If the joint was not assessed, a reason why it was not assessed was provided. The data collected are represented in the MK domain. In this example, the evaluation was done by a trained evaluator (MKEVAL = "INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR") from an x-ray using the Sharp/Genant method. Each image was assessed by 2 readers of the same role; in this example, MKEVALID is populated with "READER 1" because these assessments were performed by the first reader. The method used to obtain the image is represented in MKMETHOD = "X-RAY". The scoring method used for the assessment is precoordinated into MKTESTCD and MKTEST. Each joint location is specified in MKLOC with laterality ("RIGHT" or "LEFT") in MKLAT. Because the evaluation includes a large number of joints that would result in many records, only a subset of the data collected is shown here. The total score for the assessment was not collected, so is not represented in this dataset; it was to be derived in an ADaM dataset. Rows 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-16: Show the text description of each joint space-narrowing score in MKORRES and the corresponding numeric score in MKSTRESC/MKSTRESN. Rows 3, 6, 9, 12: Show data collected for joints that were not assessed (MKSTAT="NOT DONE"), with the reason collected on the CRF represented in MKREASND. mk.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. NV – Assumptions
1. Methods of assessment for nervous system findings may include nerve conduction studies, electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and imaging.
2. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the NV domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --
LOINC, --TOX, --TOXGR. NV – Examples Example 1 This example demonstrates the SDTM-based modeling of nervous system information collected and generated from separate positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) procedures. For this study, measures for standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were taken from 3 PET or PET/CT scans. SPDEVID shows the scanner used. NVLNKID can be used to link to the imaging procedure record in the Procedures domain (PRLNKID), as well as to the tracer administration record in the Procedure Agents domain (AGLNKID). AGLNKID would be used to determine which tracer uptake is being measured (SUVR), and therefore to which biomarker the findings pertain. NVDTC corresponds to the date of the PET or PET/CT procedure from which these results were obtained. Rows 1-2: Show the SUVR findings based on a PET/CT scan for a subject. Rows 3-4: Show the SUVR findings based on a PET/CT scan for a subject. Rows 5-6: Show the SUVR findings based on an fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scan for a subject. nv.xpt

The RELREC table displays the dataset relationship that links procedure to multiple NV domain records—specifically how an individual AG administration record related to a scan is linked to multiple NV domain records. The RELREC table uses --LNKID to relate the PR and AG domains to each other and to NV, and --REFID to relate NV and Device in Use (DU). In this example, the sponsor has maintained 2 sets of reference identifiers (REFID values) for the specific purpose of being able to relate records across multiple domains. Because the SDTMIG-MD advocates the use of --REFID to link a group of settings to the results obtained from the reading or interpretation of the test (see SDTMIG-MD, Device-in-Use (DU) domain assumptions), --LNKID has been used to establish the relationships between the procedure, the substance administered during the procedure, and the results obtained from the procedure. --LNKID is unique for each procedure for each subject, so datasets may be related to each other as a whole. Rows 1-2: Show the relationship between the scan, represented in PR, and the radiolabel tracer used, represented in AG. There is only 1 tracer administration for each scan, and only 1 scan for each tracer administration, so the relationship is one-to-one. Rows 3-4: Show the relationship between the scan, represented in PR, and the SUVR results obtained from the scan, represented in NV. Each scan yields 2 results, so the relationship is one-to-many. Rows 5-6: Show the relationship between the radiolabel tracer used and the SUVR results for each scan. This relationship may seem indirect, but it is not: The choice of radiolabel has the potential to affect the results obtained. Because the relationship between PR and AG is one-to-one and the relationship between PR and NV is one-to-many, the relationship between AG and NV must be one-to-many. Rows 7-8: Show the relationship between the SUVR results and the specific settings for the device used for each scan. There is more than 1 result from each scan, and more than 1 setting for each scan, so the relationship is many-to-many. This relationship is unusual and challenging to manage in a join/merge, and only represents the concept of this relationship. relrec.xpt

Example 2 This example shows how to represent components of a pattern-reversal visual evoked-potential (VEP) test elicited by checkerboard stimuli for a subject with optic neuritis. VEPs are detected via an EEG using leads that are placed on the back of the subject’s head. It is important to note that the nature of VEP testing is such that NVMETHOD should be equal to "EEG", and that NVCAT should be equal to "VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIAL". Several latencies from each eye—including N75, P100, and N145, as well as the P100 peak-to-peak amplitude (75-100)—are collected and should be represented in NVTESTCD/NVTEST. Details about the VEP equipment including the checkerboard size should be represented in the appropriate device domains. To interpret, each VEP component is compared against normative values established by the laboratory using healthy controls. In this example, a VEP component is considered abnormal if it falls outside of 3 standard deviations from the normative lab mean. These low and high values are stored in NVORNRLO and NVORNRHI, respectively, and the interpretation of each VEP component is represented in NVNRIND. In addition to interpreting each VEP component as normal or abnormal, the overall test for each eye may have an

interpretation. In this scenario, NVTESTCD/NVTEST should be equal to "INTP" (Interpretation) and NVORRES should represent whether the overall test in each eye is normal or abnormal. NVGRPID links the each VEP component to the overall interpretation. The NV domain should be used to represent the VEP latencies, P100 peak-to-peak amplitude, and their interpretations. SPDEVID allows the results to be related to both the VEP testing device and the checkerboard size. Rows 1-4: Show the VEP measurements for the right eye. Row 5: Shows that when all the components of right eye VEP are considered together (NVGRPID=1), the overall test is interpreted as abnormal. Rows 6-9: Show the VEP measurements for the left eye. Row 10: Shows that when all the components of left eye VEP are considered together (NVGRPID=2), the overall test is interpreted as abnormal. nv.xpt

Information about the VEP device is not shown. Identifying information would be represented using the DI domain, and any properties of the device that may change between assessments would be represented in the DO and DU domains. See the SDTMIG-MD for examples of these domains.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. OE – Assumptions
1. In ophthalmic studies, the eyes are usually sites of treatment. It is appropriate to identify sites using the variable FOCID. When FOCID is used to
identify the eyes, it is recommended that the values "OD" (oculus dexter, right eye), "OS" (oculus sinister, left eye), and "OU" (oculus uterque, both eyes) be used in FOCID. These terms are the exclusively preferred terms used by the ophthalmology community as abbreviations for the expanded Latin terms, and are included in the nonextensible CDISC Ophthalmic Focus of Study Specific Interest (OEFOCUS) codelist.
2. In any study that uses FOCID, FOCID would be included in records in any subject-level domain representing findings, interventions, or events (e.g.,
Adverse Events) related to the eyes. Whether or not FOCID is used in a study, --LOC and --LAT should be populated in records related to the eyes. The value in OELOC may be "EYE" but may also be a part of the eye (e.g., "RETINA", "CORNEA").
3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the OE domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --MODIFY, --NSPCES, --POS, --BODSYS, --ORREF, --STREFC, --STREFN, --CHRON, --DISTR, --ANTREG, --LEAD, -- FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --LLOQ, --ULOQ. OE – Examples Example 1 This example shows a general anterior segment examination performed on each eye at 1 visit, with the purpose of evaluating general abnormalities. Rows 1-2: Represent an overall interpretation (i.e., normal/abnormal) finding from the anterior segment examination, using OETESTCD="INTP". OELOC indicates that the assessor examined the lens and OELAT indicates which lens was examined. Row 3: Represents an abnormality observed during the anterior segment examination of the right eye. OEDIR="MULTIPLE" and indicates multiple directionality values are applicable. OELOC, OELAT, and the multiple OEDIR values specify the location of the abnormality represented in OEORRES and OESTRESC. This observed abnormality (i.e., red spot visible) was determined to be clinically significant (OECLSIG="Y").

Example 2 This example shows:
• Different assessments, from the front to the back of the eye, for 1 subject at 1 visit
• The use of the supplemental qualifier non-standard variable (NSV) OEEDILST (Eye Dilation Status)
The test for iris color is in the OE domain because in this use case, the medication is likely to change the result over the course of the study. Otherwise, iris color should be represented in the Subject Characteristics (SC) domain (see Section 6.3.10, Subject Characteristics). Rows 1-2: Show assessments of the color of the iris (OELOC="IRIS") for the right and left eyes, respectively. Rows 3-4: Show assessments of the status of the lens (OELOC="LENS") for the right and left eyes, respectively. This status assessment is to determine whether the lens of the eye is the natural lens (OEORRES="PHAKIC") or a replacement (OEORRES="PSEUDOPHAKIC"). Rows 5-6: Show assessments looking for the presence of hyperemia (increased blood flow). The fact that OELOC="CONJUNCTIVA" even for the left eye, where hyperemia was absent, suggests that this examination was specifically an examination of the conjunctiva. Hyperemia was identified in the right eye and was judged to be clinically significant. Rows 7-8: Show measurements of the cup-to-disc ratio for the right and left eyes, respectively. oe.xpt

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. RP – Assumptions
1. Reproductive System Findings domain contains information regarding a subject’s reproductive ability and reproductive history (e.g., number of previous pregnancies, number of births, pregnant during the
study).
2. Information on medications related to reproduction (e.g., contraceptives, fertility treatments) should be included in the Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) domain; see Section 6.1.2.
3. There are separate codelists for RP tests, responses, and units.

|  |  |  |  |  | "NONE", "NEG", and "NEGATIVE" in RPORRES, and these results effectively have the same meaning, they could be represented in standard format in |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | RPSTRESC as "NEGATIVE". |  |
| RPSTRESN | Numeric Result/Finding in<br>Standard Units | Num |  | Result<br>Qualifier | Used for continuous or numeric results or findings in standard format; copied in numeric format from RPSTRESC. RPSTRESN should store all numeric test | Perm |

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. RE – Assumptions
1. The Respiratory System Findings domain is used to represent the results/findings of respiratory diagnostic procedures (e.g., spirometry). Information
about the conduct of the procedure(s), if collected, should be submitted in the Procedures (PR) domain.
2. Many respiratory assessments require the use of a device. When data about the device used for an assessment or additional information about its use in
the assessment are collected, SPDEVID should be included in the record. See the SDTMIG for Medical Devices (SDTMIG-MD, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/medical-devices-sdtmig/) for further information about SPDEVID and the Device domains.
3. Any Identifier variables, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the RE domain, but the following qualifiers
would generally not be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, and --FAST. RE – Examples Example 1 This example shows results from several spirometry tests using either a spirometer or a peak flow meter. When spirometry tests are performed, the subject usually makes several efforts, each of which produces results, but only the best result for each test is used in analyses. In this study, the sponsor collected only the best results. The Device Identifiers (DI) domain was submitted for device identification, and the Device in Use (DU) domain was submitted to provide information about the use of the device. Because the original and standardized units of measure are identical in this example, RESTRESC, RESTRESN, RESTRESU, and RESTREFN are not shown. Instead, an ellipsis marks their place in the dataset. Spirometry test values are compared to a predicted value, rather than a normal range. Predicted values are represented in REORREF. Rows 1-2: Show the results for the spirometry tests FEV1 and FVC, with the predicted values in REORREF. The spirometer used in the tests is identified by the SPDEVID. Rows 3-4: Show the results for FEV1 and FVC as percentages of the predicted values. This result is output by the spirometer device, not derived by the sponsor. REORREF is null as there are no reference results for percent predicted tests. Row 5: Shows the results of the PEF test with the predicted values in REORREF. These results were obtained with a different device, a peak flow meter, identified by the SPDEVID.

| REELTM | Planned Elapsed Time<br>from Time Point Ref | Char | ISO 8601 duration | Timing | Planned elapsed time relative to a planned fixed reference (RETPTREF). Not a clock time or a | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | date/time variable, but an interval, represented as ISO duration. Examples: "-PT15M" to represent 15 |  |

|  |  |  |  |  | the reference time point represented by RETPTREF. |  |

Example 2 In this example, a subject made 4 attempts at the FEV1 pulmonary function test, and data about all attempts were collected. It is standard practice for multiple attempts to be made, and for the best result to be used in analyses. In this example, the spirometry report included an indicator of which was the best result. The spirometry report also included an indicator that 1 of the attempts was considered to have produced an inadequate result, with the reasons the result was considered inadequate. Rows 1-3: Show individual test results for FEV1 as measured by spirometry. Row 4: Shows an individual test result for FEV1 as measured by spirometry.

1. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the UR domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --MODIFY, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --NRIND, --LOINC, --SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, -- TOXGR, --SEV, --LLOQ. UR – Examples Example 1 This example shows measurements of the kidney, number of renal arteries and veins, and presence/absence results for prespecified abnormalities of the kidneys. These findings were made using computed tomography (CT) imaging. Row 1: Shows that the subject's left kidney was measured to be 126 mm long. Row 2: Shows that the subject's left kidney had 2 renal arteries. Row 3: Shows that the subject's left kidney had 1 renal vein. Row 4: Shows that no hematomas were found in the kidney. If a hematoma had been present, the variable URLOC (with URDIR as necessary) would have specified where within the kidney. Row 5: Shows that surgical damage was noted in the superior portion of the kidney cortex. Note that in SDTM, there is no way to clearly distinguish between the use of --LOC as a qualifier of --TEST vs. as a qualifier of results, as it is used here.

6.3.8 Physical Examination (PE)
PE - Proposed Removal of --MODIFY and --BODSYS In the version of the SDTM associated with the next version of the SDTMIG, --MODIFY is being considered for deprecation as a qualifier variable for findings class domains and --BODSYS will be considered for restriction to use in nonclinical studies. PE - Alignment with CDASH Best Practice In the CDASH "Best Practice" approach as described in the CDASHIG, which is becoming common in human clinical trials, the PE domain is not used to record the “findings” from a physical exam. The abnormalities found are recorded in the appropriate events-class domain. An abnormality is recorded in Medical History (MH) when found to previously exist at a baseline or screening examination. Abnormalities identified after baseline or screening, or worsening abnormalities, are recorded on the Adverse Events (AE) form (or possibly on a Clinical Events form). When following this approach, the PE domain is not used in SDTM. The Procedure (PR) domain is used to document the examination details (e.g., occurrence, date) using a Procedure record for each physical exam. PE – Description/Overview A findings domain that contains findings observed during a physical examination where the body is evaluated by inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. PE – Assumptions
1. PE findings reflect the presence or absence of physical signs of disease or abnormality observed during a general physical examination. Multiple body
systems are assessed during a physical examination, often starting at the head and ending at the toes, where the body is evaluated by inspection, palpation (feeling with the hands), percussion (tapping with fingers), and auscultation (listening). The examination often includes macro assessments (e.g., normal/abnormal) of appearance, general health, behavior, and body system review from head to toe. a. Evaluation of targeted body systems (e.g., cardiovascular, ophthalmic, reproductive) as part of therapeutic specific assessments should be represented in the appropriate body system domain (e.g., CV, OE, RP, respectively). b. See CDASHIG Section 8.3.11, PE - Physical Examination (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/cdash/), for additional collection guidance.
2. Abnormalities observed during a physical examination may be encoded. When collected/reported as a PE finding, the verbatim value is represented in
PEORRES and the encoded value in PESTRESC. When collected/reported as medical history or an adverse event, the verbatim value is represented in MHTERM or AETERM and the encoded value is represented in MHDECOD or AEDECOD, respectively.
3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the PE domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --XFN, --NAM, --LOINC, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR.

|  |  |  |  |  | required to be). The value should be "Y" or null. Note that PEBLFL is retained for backward compatibility. The |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | authoritative baseline flag for statistical analysis is in an ADaM dataset. |  |
| PEEVAL | Evaluator | Char | (EVAL) | Record<br>Qualifier | Role of the person who provided the evaluation. Used only for results that are subjective (e.g., assigned by a | Perm |

6.3.9 Questionnaires, Ratings, and Scales (QRS) Domains (FT, QS, RS)
This section includes domains used to represent data from questionnaires, ratings, and scales (QRS). The Functional Tests (FT) and Questionnaires (QS) sections each provide an overview, specifications, assumptions, and examples for these domains. The Disease Response and Clin Classification (RS) section contains an overview and specification for that domain; assumptions and examples are provided in subsections for the 2 use cases within the RS domain (i.e., disease response use case, clinical classifications use case). The SDTMIG includes the FT, QS, and RS domains for QRS findings for different QRS concepts. These differ only in concept, in domain code, and in informative content such as examples. A set of shared assumptions is included in each of the domain sections. CDISC develops controlled terminology and publishes supplements for individual QRS instruments when the instrument is in the public domain or when permission has been granted by the copyright holder.
• Controlled Terminology release downloads and information about the CT development process are available
at: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
• QRS supplements, implementation documents, and information about the QRS development process are available
at: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs. Each QRS supplement includes instrument-specific implementation assumptions, a dataset example, SDTM mapping strategies, and a list of any applicable supplemental qualifiers. SDTM annotated CRFs are also provided where available.

FT – Assumptions The following assumptions are unique to the FT domain:
1. A functional test is not a subjective assessment of how the subject generally performs a task, but rather an objective measurement of the performance of
the task by the subject in a specific instance.
2. Functional tests have documented methods for administration and analysis and require a subject to perform specific activities that are evaluated and
recorded. Most often, functional tests are direct quantitative measurements. Examples of functional tests include the Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test, and the Hauser Ambulation Index. QRS Shared Assumptions The following assumptions are common to the FT and QS domains as well as the Clinical Classifications use case of the RS domain (not the Disease Response use case of RS):
1. The name of a QRS instrument is described under the variable --CAT in the relevant QRS domain (i.e., FT, QS, RS), and may be either abbreviations or
longer names. For example, "ADAS-COG", "BPI SHORT FORM", and "APACHE II" are all --CATs which are shortened names for the instruments they represent, whereas "4 STAIR ASCEND" is the FTCAT for the instrument of the same name. Sponsors should always reference CDISC Controlled Terminology. a. The QRS Naming Rules for --CAT, --TEST, and --TESTCD and the list of QRS instruments that have published CDISC Controlled Terminology with NCI/EVS are available at: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology. b. Refer to the following CDISC Controlled Terminology codelists for QRS instrument --CAT terminology: i. Category of Clinical Classification ii. Category of Functional Test iii. Category of Questionnaire c. QRS --TESTCD/--TEST terminology codelists are listed separately by instrument name.
2. Names of subcategories for groups of items/questions are described under the --SCAT variable.
a. --SCAT values are not included in the CDISC Controlled Terminology system but rather controlled as described in the QRS supplements in which they are used.
3. There are cases where QRS CRFs do not include numeric “standardized responses” assigned to text responses (e.g., mild, moderate, severe being 1, 2,
3). It is clearly in everyone's best interest to include the numeric “standardized responses” in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. This is only done when the numeric “standardized responses” are documented in the QRS CRF instructions, a user manual, a website specific to the QRS instrument, or another reference document that provides a clear explanation and rationale for providing them in the SDTMIG QRS dataset.
4. Sponsors should always consult published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in a SDTMIG QRS domain. Derived
variable results in QRS are usually considered captured data. If sponsors operationally derive variable results, then the derived records that are submitted in a QRS domain should be flagged by --DRVFL. a. The following rules apply for “total”-type scores in QRS datasets.


## Page 322

i. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores listed on the CRF are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. ii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF but documented in an associated instrument manual or reference paper are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. iii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF, but known to be included in eData by sponsors are considered as captured data, are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. The QRS instrument’s CT is considered extensible for this case and the subtotal or total score should be requested to be added.
1. Any imputations/calculations done to numeric “standardized responses” to produce the total score via transforming numeric “standardized
responses” in any way would be done as ADaM derivations. b. The QRS instrument subtotal or total score, which is the sum of the numeric responses for an instrument, is populated in --ORRES, --STRESC, and --STRESN. It is considered a captured subtotal or total score without any knowledge of the sponsor-data management processes related to the score. i. If operationally derived by the sponsor, it is the sponsor's responsibility to set the --DRVFL flag based on their eCRF process to derive subtotal and total scores. An investigator-derived score written on a CRF will be considered a captured score and not flagged. When subtotal and total scores are derived by the sponsor, the derived flag (--DRVFL) is set to "Y". However, when the subtotal and total scores are received from a central provider or vendor, the value would go into --ORRES and --DRVFL would be null (see Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for Variables).
5. The variable --REPNUM variable is populated when there are multiple repeats of the same question. When records are related to the first trial of the
question, the variable --REPNUM should be set to "1". When records are related to the second trial of the same question, --REPNUM should be set to "2", and so forth.
6. The actual version number of an instrument is represented in the --CAT value as designated by the QRS Terminology Team. If it is determined that this
is not the case for an instrument: a. Notify the QRS Terminology Team that the instrument has a specific or multiple version numbers. This team will assist in providing an resolution on how the situation will be handled. b. Consider the use of the --GRPID variable to indicate the instrument's version number prior to a decision by the QRS Terminology Team. c. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the version used for each QRS instrument in the metadata (using the Comments column in the Define-XML document). This could be provided as value-level metadata for --CAT. d. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the scoring rules in the metadata.
7. If the variable --TEST is represented with verbatim text >40 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in --TEST within 40 characters and
describe the full text of the item in the study metadata. If the verbatim item response (e.g., --QSORRES) is >200 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in QSORRES within the 200 characters and describe the full text in the study metadata; see Section 4 of the QRS supplement. See Section 4.5.3, Text Strings that Exceed the Maximum Length for General Observation-class Domain Variables, for further information. a. The instrument’s annotated CRF can also be used as a reference for the full text in both of these situations.
8. --EVAL and --EVALID must not be used to model QRS data in SDTM. These variables have had various interpretations on QRS CRFs and were used
to represent a multitude of evaluator information about QRS instruments. This has made it more difficult for users of SDTM QRS data to interpret this

data and more difficult to pool data for analyses. If needed, supplemental qualifiers may be used to represent this data. Updated information on a proposed solution to this issue will be posted on the CDISC QRS webpage (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs).
9. All standard QRS supplement development is coordinated with the CDISC SDS QRS Subteam as the governing body. The process involves drafting the
controlled terminology and defining instrument-specific standardized values for qualifier, timing, and result variables to populate the SDTMIG FT, QS, and RS domains. These supplements are developed based on user demand and therapeutic area standards development needs. Sponsors should always consult the CDISC website to review the terminology and supplements prior to modeling any QRS instrument. a. Sponsors may participate and/or request the development of additional QRS supplements and terminology through the CDISC SDS QRS subteam and the Controlled Terminology QRS subteam. i. Once generated, the QRS supplement is posted on the CDISC website (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs). ii. Sponsors should always consult the published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in SDTMIG-based domains.
10. Any identifiers, timing variables, or findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to a QRS domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STRNC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --LOC, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.

For example, "ADAS-COG", "BPI SHORT FORM", and "APACHE II" are all --CATs which are shortened names for the instruments they represent, whereas "4 STAIR ASCEND" is the FTCAT for the instrument of the same name. Sponsors should always reference CDISC Controlled Terminology. a. The QRS Naming Rules for --CAT, --TEST, and --TESTCD and the list of QRS instruments that have published CDISC Controlled Terminology with NCI/EVS are available at: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology. b.

3). It is clearly in everyone's best interest to include the numeric “standardized responses” in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. This is only done when the numeric “standardized responses” are documented in the QRS CRF instructions, a user manual, a website specific to the QRS instrument, or another reference document that provides a clear explanation and rationale for providing them in the SDTMIG QRS dataset.

4. Sponsors should always consult published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in a SDTMIG QRS domain. Derived
variable results in QRS are usually considered captured data. If sponsors operationally derive variable results, then the derived records that are submitted in a QRS domain should be flagged by --DRVFL. a. The following rules apply for “total”-type scores in QRS datasets. i. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores listed on the CRF are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. ii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF but documented in an associated instrument manual or reference paper are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. iii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF, but known to be included in eData by sponsors are considered as captured data, are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. The QRS instrument’s CT is considered extensible for this case and the subtotal or total score should be requested to be added.
1. Any imputations/calculations done to numeric “standardized responses” to produce the total score via transforming numeric “standardized
responses” in any way would be done as ADaM derivations. b. The QRS instrument subtotal or total score, which is the sum of the numeric responses for an instrument, is populated in --ORRES, --STRESC, and --STRESN. It is considered a captured subtotal or total score without any knowledge of the sponsor-data management processes related to the score. i. If operationally derived by the sponsor, it is the sponsor's responsibility to set the --DRVFL flag based on their eCRF process to derive subtotal and total scores. An investigator-derived score written on a CRF will be considered a captured score and not flagged. When subtotal and total scores are derived by the sponsor, the derived flag (--DRVFL) is set to "Y". However, when the subtotal and total scores are received from a central provider or vendor, the value would go into --ORRES and --DRVFL would be null (see Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for Variables).
5. The variable --REPNUM variable is populated when there are multiple repeats of the same question. When records are related to the first trial of the
question, the variable --REPNUM should be set to "1". When records are related to the second trial of the same question, --REPNUM should be set to "2", and so forth.
6. The actual version number of an instrument is represented in the --CAT value as designated by the QRS Terminology Team. If it is determined that this
is not the case for an instrument: a. Notify the QRS Terminology Team that the instrument has a specific or multiple version numbers. This team will assist in providing an resolution on how the situation will be handled. b. Consider the use of the --GRPID variable to indicate the instrument's version number prior to a decision by the QRS Terminology Team. c. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the version used for each QRS instrument in the metadata (using the Comments column in the Define-XML document). This could be provided as value-level metadata for --CAT. d. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the scoring rules in the metadata.
7. If the variable --TEST is represented with verbatim text >40 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in --TEST within 40 characters and
describe the full text of the item in the study metadata. If the verbatim item response (e.g., --QSORRES) is >200 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in QSORRES within the 200 characters and describe the full text in the study metadata; see Section 4 of the QRS supplement. See Section 4.5.3, Text Strings that Exceed the Maximum Length for General Observation-class Domain Variables, for further information.

a. The instrument’s annotated CRF can also be used as a reference for the full text in both of these situations.
8. --EVAL and --EVALID must not be used to model QRS data in SDTM. These variables have had various interpretations on QRS CRFs and were used
to represent a multitude of evaluator information about QRS instruments. This has made it more difficult for users of SDTM QRS data to interpret this data and more difficult to pool data for analyses. If needed, supplemental qualifiers may be used to represent this data. Updated information on a proposed solution to this issue will be posted on the CDISC QRS webpage (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs).
9. All standard QRS supplement development is coordinated with the CDISC SDS QRS Subteam as the governing body. The process involves drafting the
controlled terminology and defining instrument-specific standardized values for qualifier, timing, and result variables to populate the SDTMIG FT, QS, and RS domains. These supplements are developed based on user demand and therapeutic area standards development needs. Sponsors should always consult the CDISC website to review the terminology and supplements prior to modeling any QRS instrument. a. Sponsors may participate and/or request the development of additional QRS supplements and terminology through the CDISC SDS QRS subteam and the Controlled Terminology QRS subteam. i. Once generated, the QRS supplement is posted on the CDISC website (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs). ii. Sponsors should always consult the published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in SDTMIG-based domains.
10. Any identifiers, timing variables, or findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to a QRS domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STRNC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --LOC, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV. QS – Examples CDISC publishes supplements for individual questionnaires (at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs). Additional QS examples can be found in supplements on that webpage. Example 1 Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) The example represents the items from the SWLS instrument. qs.xpt

6.3.9.3 Disease Response and Clin Classification (RS)
RS – Description/Overview A findings domain for the assessment of disease response to therapy, or clinical classification based on published criteria. Data in this domain may or may not be collected by means of a standard CRF.
• Clinical classification instruments usually have a standard CRF for data capture, but also may instead be based on an evaluator providing response
evaluations based on published criteria.
• Oncology response criteria are evaluated based on published criteria.
• Additional disease classifications or scoring systems (e.g., staging criteria) are based on published criteria.
• There are separate supplements prepared for clinical classification instruments and therapeutic-area disease response criteria use cases.
RS – Specification rs.xpt, Disease Response and Clin Classification — Findings. One record per response assessment or clinical classification assessment per time point per visit per subject per assessor per medical evaluator, Tabulation.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. Assumptions and examples are different for the disease response and clinical classifications use cases.
6.3.9.3.1 Disease Response Use Case
RS – Disease Response Use Case Assumptions Assumptions here discuss the oncology use case, which is the only disease-response use case that currently exists.
1. RSCAT is used to group a set of assessments based on a disease response criterion (published or protocol-defined). One of the codelists for RSCAT is
ONCRSCAT. The ONCRSCAT codelist contains controlled terminology for oncology disease response assessments.
2. Oncology response criteria assess the change in tumor burden, an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics: Both tumor
shrinkage (objective response) and disease progression are useful endpoints in cancer clinical trials. The RS domain is applicable for representing responses to assessment criteria such as RECIST[1] or Lugano classification.[2] The SDTM domain examples provided reference RECIST. Disease Response supplements will be developed as 1 supplement per response criterion and will contained criterion-specific guidance and examples. a. CDISC submission values and definitions in the ONCRSR codelist have been developed to facilitate reuse by keeping the definitions focused on the meaning of the result rather than on relating them to a specific published criterion or a particular tumor type. CDISC submission values and definitions are intended to apply across multiple tumor types, imaging modalities, therapeutic agents, and published criterion. This means that there may be cases where the appropriate ONCRSR CDISC submission value may not exactly match the term used in the published criterion. It is expected that clinicians should use the precise criterion definitions outlined in the individual papers to assign the appropriate response according to the CDISC submission values. b. The terms "response" and "remission" are commonly used to describe functionally synonymous terms. "Response" is used in CDISC submission values based on the following agreement: FDA, CDISC, NCI-EVS, and select academic experts came to consensus that because the words "response" (used in solid tumors as an indicator of a favorable change in tumor burden) and "remission" (used in non-solid tumors) were functionally synonymous, 2 distinct terms were not required to be added to the ONCRSR codelist. Instead, "remission" has been added as a synonym in all instances where "response" is used in a CDISC submission value, for response values used in both solid and non-solid tumors. The FDA expects a single CDISC submission value to be submitted for both solid and non-solid tumors. c. Refer to the Controlled Terminology Rules for Oncology for more information (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology). d. RSTESTCD/RSTEST values for this domain are published as Controlled Terminology. For some RSTESTCD/RSTEST values, CDISC CT includes codelists for use with RSORRES. The associations between the test values and results are in the Oncology codetable, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.

3. The RS domain disease response criteria use case may include records derived by the investigator or with a data collection tool, but not sponsor-derived
records. Sponsor-derived records and results should be provided in an analysis dataset (ADaM). a. For disease response criteria, the BEST Response assessment records are included in the RS domain only when provided by the investigator or an independent assessor (i.e., Best responses that are derived by the sponsor for the analysis are not included in the RS domain).
4. The RSLNKGRP variable is used to provide a link between the records in a findings domain (e.g., Tumor/Lesion Results, TR; Laboratory Test Results,
LB) that contribute to a record in the RS domain. Records should exist in the RELREC dataset to support this relationship. A RELREC relationship could also be defined using RSLNKID when a response evaluation or clinical classification measure relates back to another source dataset (e.g., tumor assessment in TR). The domain in which data that contribute to an assessment of response reside should not affect whether a link to the RS record through a RELREC relationship is created. For example, a set of oncology response criteria might require lab results in the LB domain, not only tumor results in the TR domain.
5. When using the RS domain to represent response evaluation or clinical classification instruments that incorporate data from other domains:
a. Whenever possible, all source data must be represented in the topic-based domain(s) to which they pertain. For example, if a lab test value is collected and then scored for a response evaluation, the lab test value must be recorded in the LB domain using the rules that apply to the domain and the tests being represented. b. In the oncology setting, the response to therapy would often be determined, at least in part, from data in the TR domain. Data from other sources (in other SDTM domains) might also be used in an assessment of response (e.g., lab test results, assessments of symptoms). c. Oncology response assessments sometimes include symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration may be considered as non-radiologic evidence of progressive disease. Symptomatic deterioration is recorded in RS with RSTEST = "Symptomatic Deterioration" and the standardized response (e.g., "PD") in RSSTRESC.

d. In all cases, RSSTRESC should be populated as indicated in controlled terminology.
6. Best response, duration of response, or the progression to prior therapies and follow-up therapies may be represented in the RS domain.
a. The record in RS may be related and linked to record(s) in Concomitant/Prior Medications (CM) using CMLNKGRP and RSLNKGRP. Likewise, the link to Procedures (PR; e.g., radiotherapy, surgery) would be made using PRLNKGRP. b. If the criteria used to determine the response is unknown or not collected, this is represented as RSCAT = "UNSPECIFIED".
7. The evaluator identifier variable (RSEVALID) can be used in conjunction with RSEVAL to provide additional detail of who is providing the
assessment. For example, RSEVAL = "INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR" and RSEVALID = "RADIOLOGIST 1" may further qualify the RSEVALID variable. RSEVALID may be subject to controlled terminology but may also represent free text values depending on the use case. When used with disease response data, RSEVALID is subject to MEDEVAL controlled terminology.
8. In cases where an independent assessor identifies one of multiple assessments/measurements to be the accepted one, the accepted record flag variable
(RSACPTFL) identifies records that have been determined to be the accepted assessments/measurements by an independent assessor. This flag would

| RSTESTCD | RSTEST | RSCAT | RSORRES | RSSTRESC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SYMPTDTR | Symptomatic<br>Deterioration | PROTOCOL DEFINED<br>RESPONSE CRITERIA | Increased weakness and<br>weight loss | PD |


## Page 334

be provided by an independent assessor when multiple assessors (e.g., "RADIOLOGIST 1", "RADIOLOGIST 2", "ADJUDICATOR") provide assessments or evaluations at the same time point or for an overall evaluation. a. RSACPTFL should not be derived by the sponsor. If a derivation is needed to make the record selection, then this derivation should be done in the analysis dataset (ADaM).
9. Disease recurrence can be represented in the RS domain using RSTEST = "Disease Recurrence Indicator" to indicate that there was an assessment of
whether there was disease recurrence. The RSCAT = "PROTOCOL DEFINED RESPONSE CRITERIA" can be used to indicate that the response assessment of disease recurrence was based on protocol-specified criteria rather than published response criteria.
10. When a disease response result is based on multiple procedures/scans/images/physical exams performed on different dates, RSDTC may be derived .
11. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the RS domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV. RS – Examples - Disease Response The following are examples for oncology response criteria. Example 1 This example shows response assessments determined from the TR domain based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and also shows a case where progressive disease due to symptomatic deterioration was determined based on a clinical assessment by the investigator. Rows 1-3: Show the target response, non-target response, and the overall response by the investigator using RECIST 1.1 at the week 6 visit. Rows 4-7: Show the target response and non-target response by the investigator using RECIST 1.1, as well as the determination of symptomatic determination (pleural effusion) and overall response using protocol-defined response criteria, at the week 12 visit. rs.xpt

Example 2 This example shows response assessments determined from the TR domain based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and also shows a confirmation of an equivocal new lesion progression.

6.3.9.3.2 Clinical Classifications Use Case
RS – Clinical Classifications Use Case Assumptions The following assumptions are unique to the RS domain clinical classifications use case:
1. Clinical classifications are named instruments whose output is an ordinal or categorical score that serves as a surrogate for or ranking of disease status or other physiological or biological status.
a. Clinical classifications may be based solely on objective data from clinical records, or they may involve a clinical judgment or interpretation of directly observable signs, behaviors, or other physical manifestations related to a condition or subject status. These physical manifestations may be findings (e.g., lab results, vital signs, clinical events) that are typically represented in other SDTM domains .
2. RSCAT is used to group a set of assessments based on a clinical classification. One of the codelists for RSCAT is CCCAT. The CCCAT codelist contains CDISC Controlled Terminology for clinical
classifications instruments.
3. When using the RS domain to represent a clinical classification instrument that incorporates data from other domains:
a. Whenever possible, all source data must be represented in the topic-based domain(s) to which they pertain. For example, if a lab test value is collected and then scored for a response evaluation or clinical classification instrument, the lab test value must be recorded in the LB domain using the rules that apply to that domain and the tests being represented. b. If the source value is directly collected on the clinical classification instrument, then the values from the source record may be transcribed to the corresponding RS record, with RSORRES and RSORRESU populated to agree with the units shown on the clinical classification instrument, which may be different from the sponsor’s usual practice for original and standard units. c. If a clinical classification uses a a source value by comparing it to a range (e.g., "2-5", ">3"), then the source value will exist only in the source domain; the range is represented in the corresponding RS record in RSORRES and RSORRESU. d. In all cases, RSSTRESC/RSSTRESN should be populated with the assigned ordinal score as indicated on the instrument.

The following assumptions are common to the FT and QS domains as well as the Clinical Classifications use case of the RS domain (not the Disease Response use case of RS):
1. The name of a QRS instrument is described under the variable --CAT in the relevant QRS domain (i.e., FT, QS, RS), and may be either abbreviations or
longer names. For example, "ADAS-COG", "BPI SHORT FORM", and "APACHE II" are all --CATs which are shortened names for the instruments they represent, whereas "4 STAIR ASCEND" is the FTCAT for the instrument of the same name. Sponsors should always reference CDISC Controlled Terminology. a. The QRS Naming Rules for --CAT, --TEST, and --TESTCD and the list of QRS instruments that have published CDISC Controlled Terminology with NCI/EVS are available at: https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology. b. Refer to the following CDISC Controlled Terminology codelists for QRS instrument --CAT terminology: i. Category of Clinical Classification ii. Category of Functional Test iii. Category of Questionnaire c. QRS --TESTCD/--TEST terminology codelists are listed separately by instrument name.
2. Names of subcategories for groups of items/questions are described under the --SCAT variable.
a. --SCAT values are not included in the CDISC Controlled Terminology system but rather controlled as described in the QRS supplements in which they are used.
3. There are cases where QRS CRFs do not include numeric “standardized responses” assigned to text responses (e.g., mild, moderate, severe being 1, 2,
3). It is clearly in everyone's best interest to include the numeric “standardized responses” in the SDTMIG QRS dataset. This is only done when the numeric “standardized responses” are documented in the QRS CRF instructions, a user manual, a website specific to the QRS instrument, or another reference document that provides a clear explanation and rationale for providing them in the SDTMIG QRS dataset.
4. Sponsors should always consult published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in a SDTMIG QRS domain. Derived
variable results in QRS are usually considered captured data. If sponsors operationally derive variable results, then the derived records that are submitted in a QRS domain should be flagged by --DRVFL. a. The following rules apply for “total”-type scores in QRS datasets. i. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores listed on the CRF are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. ii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF but documented in an associated instrument manual or reference paper are considered captured data and are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. iii. QRS subtotal, total, etc. scores not listed on the CRF, but known to be included in eData by sponsors are considered as captured data, are included in the instrument’s controlled terminology. The QRS instrument’s CT is considered extensible for this case and the subtotal or total score should be requested to be added.
1. Any imputations/calculations done to numeric “standardized responses” to produce the total score via transforming numeric “standardized
responses” in any way would be done as ADaM derivations.


## Page 338

b. The QRS instrument subtotal or total score, which is the sum of the numeric responses for an instrument, is populated in --ORRES, --STRESC, and --STRESN. It is considered a captured subtotal or total score without any knowledge of the sponsor-data management processes related to the score. i. If operationally derived by the sponsor, it is the sponsor's responsibility to set the --DRVFL flag based on their eCRF process to derive subtotal and total scores. An investigator-derived score written on a CRF will be considered a captured score and not flagged. When subtotal and total scores are derived by the sponsor, the derived flag (--DRVFL) is set to "Y". However, when the subtotal and total scores are received from a central provider or vendor, the value would go into --ORRES and --DRVFL would be null (see Section 4.1.8.1, Origin Metadata for Variables).
5. The variable --REPNUM variable is populated when there are multiple repeats of the same question. When records are related to the first trial of the
question, the variable --REPNUM should be set to "1". When records are related to the second trial of the same question, --REPNUM should be set to "2", and so forth.
6. The actual version number of an instrument is represented in the --CAT value as designated by the QRS Terminology Team. If it is determined that this
is not the case for an instrument: a. Notify the QRS Terminology Team that the instrument has a specific or multiple version numbers. This team will assist in providing an resolution on how the situation will be handled. b. Consider the use of the --GRPID variable to indicate the instrument's version number prior to a decision by the QRS Terminology Team. c. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the version used for each QRS instrument in the metadata (using the Comments column in the Define-XML document). This could be provided as value-level metadata for --CAT. d. The sponsor is expected to provide information about the scoring rules in the metadata.
7. If the variable --TEST is represented with verbatim text >40 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in --TEST within 40 characters and
describe the full text of the item in the study metadata. If the verbatim item response (e.g., --QSORRES) is >200 characters, represent the abbreviated meaningful text in QSORRES within the 200 characters and describe the full text in the study metadata; see Section 4 of the QRS supplement. See Section 4.5.3, Text Strings that Exceed the Maximum Length for General Observation-class Domain Variables, for further information. a. The instrument’s annotated CRF can also be used as a reference for the full text in both of these situations.
8. --EVAL and --EVALID must not be used to model QRS data in SDTM. These variables have had various interpretations on QRS CRFs and were used
to represent a multitude of evaluator information about QRS instruments. This has made it more difficult for users of SDTM QRS data to interpret this data and more difficult to pool data for analyses. If needed, supplemental qualifiers may be used to represent this data. Updated information on a proposed solution to this issue will be posted on the CDISC QRS webpage (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs).
9. All standard QRS supplement development is coordinated with the CDISC SDS QRS Subteam as the governing body. The process involves drafting the
controlled terminology and defining instrument-specific standardized values for qualifier, timing, and result variables to populate the SDTMIG FT, QS, and RS domains. These supplements are developed based on user demand and therapeutic area standards development needs. Sponsors should always consult the CDISC website to review the terminology and supplements prior to modeling any QRS instrument. a. Sponsors may participate and/or request the development of additional QRS supplements and terminology through the CDISC SDS QRS subteam and the Controlled Terminology QRS subteam. i. Once generated, the QRS supplement is posted on the CDISC website (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/qrs).


## Page 339

ii. Sponsors should always consult the published QRS supplements for guidance on submitting derived information in SDTMIG-based domains.
10. Any identifiers, timing variables, or findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to a QRS domain, but the following qualifiers would
generally not be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STRNC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --LOC, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.

1. The structure of subject characteristics is based on the Findings general observation class and is an extension of the demographics data, including
socioeconomic or other broad characteristics. The structure for demographic data is fixed and includes date of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and country. Subject characteristics may be collected periodically over time. Some examples of subject characteristics include education level, marital status, and national origin.
2. Associations between some subject characteristic tests and response codelists are described in the SC Codetable, available
at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
3. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the SC domain, but the following qualifiers would

Although there is a test for gestational age in the CDISC Controlled Terminology for Reproductive Findings, gestational age is an attribute of the fetus or infant, and is not a finding about their reproductive system; in this example, gestational age is represented in the Subject Characteristics (SC) domain. The structure of the SC domain formerly was 1 record per characteristic (test) per subject, but with this version of the SDTMIG the structure has changed to allow multiple records per test. This example shows multiple estimates of gestational age for the same subject. Not all of the values of METHOD shown in this example are currently in the METHOD codelist. Gestational age is often expressed (and sometimes collected) in weeks and days. SDTM does not support the recording of an individual finding result with mixed units (e.g., "20 weeks and 5 days"), so the gestational age would be converted to days for representation in SDTM. sc.xpt

Example 3 This example shows data from a multi-year study in which marital status and whether the subject was a student were collected annually. sc.xpt

6.3.12 Tumor/Lesion Domains
The Tumor/Lesion domains (TU, TR) represent data collected in clinical trials where sites of disease (e.g., tumors/lesions/locations of interest, lymph nodes, organs of interest in the assessment of the disease) are identified and then repeatedly measured/assessed at subsequent time points and often used in an evaluation of disease response(s). As such, these domains would be applicable for representing data to support disease response criteria. These 2 domains each have a distinct purpose and are related to each other, and may also be related to assessments in the RS domain (see Section 6.3.9.3, Disease Response and Clin Classification).
6.3.12.1 Tumor/Lesion Identification (TU)
TU – Description/Overview A findings domain that represents data that uniquely identifies tumors, lesions, or locations of interest under study. The TU domain represents data that uniquely identifies tumors, lesions, or locations of interest (e.g., tumors, cardiovascular culprit lesions, organs, bone marrow, other sites of disease such as lymph nodes). Commonly, tumors/lesions/locations of interest are identified by an investigator and/or independent assessor and classified according to the disease assessment criteria. For example, an oncology study using RECIST criteria would identify target, non-target, and new tumors. A record in the TU domain contains the following information:
• a unique tumor ID value

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. TU – Assumptions
1. The TU domain should contain only 1 record for each unique tumor/lesion/location of interest identified by an assessor (e.g., investigator, independent
assessor) per medical evaluator. The initial identification of a tumor/lesion/location of interest is done once, usually at baseline (e.g., identification of target and non-target tumors/lesions) or first appearance of new tumor/lesion. The identification information, including the location description, must not be repeated for every visit. A record is required in TU to identify and create the TULNKID when there are associated records in TR with matching TRLNKID. The following are examples of when post-baseline records might be included in the TU domain: a. A new tumor/lesion may emerge at any time during a study; therefore, a new post-baseline record would represent the identification of the new tumor/lesion. b. If a tumor/lesion identified at baseline subsequently splits into separate distinct tumors/lesions, then additional post-baseline records can be included to distinctly identify the split tumors/lesions.

c. In situations where a re-baseline of targets and non-targets is required (e.g., a cross-over study), then a separate set of target and non-target tumors/lesions might be identified and those identification records would be represented.
2. TRLNKID is used to relate an identification record in the TU domain to assessment records in the
Tumor/Lesion Results (TR) domain. The organization of data across the TU and TR domains requires a linking mechanism. The TULNKID variable is used to provide a unique code for each identified tumor/lesion. The values of TULNKID are compound values that may carry the following information: an indication of the role (or assessor) providing the data record, when it is someone other than the principal investigator; an indication of whether the data record is for a target or non-target tumor/lesion; a tracking identifier or number; and an indication of whether the tumor/lesion has split (see assumption 3 for details on splitting). A RELREC relationship record can be created to describe the link, probably as a dataset-todataset link. TUTESTCD/TUTEST values for this domain are published as Controlled Terminology. For some TUTESTCD/TUTEST values, CDISC CT includes codelists for use with TUORRES. The associations between the test values and results are in the Oncology codetable, which, along with the CT Rules for Oncology, is available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology. During the course of a trial, a tumor/lesion might split into one or more distinct tumors/lesions, or 2 or more tumors/lesions might merge to form a single tumor/lesion. The following example shows the preferred approach for representing split lesions in TU. However, the approach depends on how the data for split and merged tumors/lesions are captured. The preferred approach requires the measurements of each distinct tumor/lesion to be captured individually. Example target tumor T04, identified at the screening visit, splits into 2 at week 16. Two new records are created with TUTEST = "Tumor Split”; TULNKID reflects the split by adding 0.1 and 0.2 to the original TULNKID value.

If the data collection does not support this approach (i.e., measurements of split tumors/lesions are reported as a summary under the "parent" tumor/lesion), then it may not be possible to include a record in the TU domain. In this situation, the assessments of split and merge tumors/lesions would be represented only in the TR domain.
3. For some response criteria (e.g., Lugano, Kumar IMWG 2016), tumors are assessed by location of interest.
A record is required in TU in order to link the assessments of the particular location of interest in TR. This example represents tumors assessed by location of interest. In TULNKID = "L01", the spleen is identified as a location of interest using computerized tomography (CT) scan. In TULNKID = "L04", the whole body is identified as a location of interest using positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

| TULNKID | TUTESTCD | TUTEST | TUORRES | VISIT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | TARGET | SCREEN |
| T02 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | TARGET | SCREEN |
| T03 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | TARGET | SCREEN |
| T04 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | TARGET | SCREEN |

| T04.2 | TUSPLIT | Tumor Split | TARGET | WEEK 16 |
| NEW01 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | NEW | WEEK 32 |

4. During the course of a trial, when a new tumor/lesion is identified, information about that new tumor/lesion
may be collected to different levels of detail. For example, if anatomical location of a new tumor/lesion is not collected, TULOC will be blank. All new tumors/lesions are to be represented in TU and TR domains.

| TULNKID | TUTESTCD | TUTEST | TUORRES | TULOC | TUMETHOD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L01 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | LOCATION OF<br>INTEREST | SPLEEN | CT SCAN |

| L03 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | LOCATION OF<br>INTEREST | BONE MARROW | PET SCAN |
| L04 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | LOCATION OF<br>INTEREST | BODY | PET SCAN |


## Page 348

5. The additional anatomical location variables --LAT, --DIR, --PORTOT were added from the SDTM. These
extra variables allow for more detailed information to be collected that further clarifies the value of the TULOC variable.
6. In the oncology setting, when a new tumor is identified, a record must be included in both the TU and TR
domains. At a minimum, the TR record would contain TRLNKID = "NEW0" and TRTESTCD = "TUMSTATE" and TRORRES = "PRESENT" for unequivocal new tumors. The TU record may contain different levels of detail depending upon the data collection methods employed. Although it is possible that a sponsor may have a different chosen method, the following are the most common scenarios: a. The occurrence of a new tumor/lesion is the sole piece of information that a sponsor collects, because this is a sign of disease progression; no further details are required. In such cases, a record would be created where TUTEST = "Tumor Identification" and TUORRES = "NEW", and the identifier, TULNKID, would be populated in order to link to the associated information in the TR domain. b. The occurrence of a new tumor/lesion and the anatomical location of that newly identified tumor/lesion are the only collected pieces of information. In this case, it is expected that a record would be created where TUTEST = “Tumor Identification” and TUORRES = "NEW"; the TULOC variable would be populated with the anatomical location information (the additional location variables may be populated depending on the level of detail collected), and the identifier, TULNKID, would be populated in order to link to the associated information in the TR domain. c. The sponsor records the occurrence of a new tumor/lesion to the same level of detail as target tumors/lesions. For example, with the occurrence of a new tumor/lesion, its anatomical location and its measurement might be recorded. In this case, it is expected that a record would be created where TUTEST = "Tumor Identification" and TUORRES = "NEW". The TULOC variable would be populated with the anatomical location information (the additional location variables may be populated depending on the level of detail collected) and the identifier, TULNKID, would be populated in order to link to the associated information in the TR domain. In this scenario, measurements/assessments would also be recorded in the TR domain.
7. The acceptance flag variable (TUACPTFL) identifies records that have been determined to be the accepted
assessments/measurements by an independent assessor. This flag would be provided by an independent assessor and when multiple evaluators (e.g., "RADIOLOGIST 1", "RADIOLOGIST 2", "ADJUDICATOR") provide assessments or evaluations at the same time point or an overall evaluation. This flag should not be used by a sponsor for any other purpose. It is not expected that the TUACPTFL flag would be populated by the sponsor; instead, that type of record selection should be handled in the analysis dataset (ADaM).
8. The evaluator-specified variable TUEVALID is used in conjunction with TUEVAL to provide additional
detail regarding who is providing tumor identification information (e.g., TUEVAL = "INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR", TUEVALID = "RADIOLOGIST 1"). The TUEVALID variable is subject to controlled terminology. Note: TUEVAL must also be populated when TUEVALID is populated.
9. If indicator questions for specific types of tumor or lesions are collected (e.g., Does the subject have target
tumors? Does the subject have any non-targets? Did the subject have metastatic disease at screening?), then these TUTESTs will be included in TU. If indicator questions are not collected, do not introduce them into TU. This example shows indicator TUTESTs for a subject with non-target lesions only.

This example shows indicator TUTESTs for the identification of the sites of metastatic disease sites at baseline.

| TULNKID | TUTESTCD | TUTEST | TUORRES | TULOC | TUMETHOD |

|  | TIND | Target Indicator | N |  | CT SCAN |
| NT01 | TUMIDENT | Tumor Identification | NON-TARGET | LUNG | CT SCAN |

10. Disease recurrence can be represented in the TU domain as an identification for the appearance of new
tumors. The TUTEST Disease Recurrence Relative Location is used identify the region or relative location for the disease recurrence. The image identifier is in TUREFID and may match a PRREFID in the Procedures (PR) domain. The PR domain would contain the scans performed per protocol at each assessment; only when new tumors appear would records be included in TU. This example shows disease recurrence data in an adjuvant breast cancer study where the subject was initially diagnosed with cancer in the left breast only. This example shows a case where disease recurrence was identified in various locations. TUTEST=Disease Recurrence Relative Location is used to identify the reference location of the recurrence (e.g., LOCAL, REGIONAL, DISTANT, LOCOREGIONAL). A local disease recurrence was identified in the left breast, regional disease recurrence was identified in the ipsilateral internal mammary and the ipsilateral infraclavicular nodes, distant disease recurrence was identified in the liver and colon, and contralateral disease recurrence was identified in the right breast.

11. The following proposed supplemental qualifiers would be used for oncology studies to represent
information regarding previous irradiation of a tumor when that information is captured in association with a specific tumor.

| IMG-00007 | CON01 | DRCRLTLC | Disease<br>Recurrence<br>Relative<br>Location | CONTRALATE<br>RAL | BREAST | RIGHT | CT SCAN |

12. When additional data are collected about a procedure used for tumor/lesion identification, the data about
the procedure are stored in the PR domain; the link between the tumor/lesion identification and the procedure should be recorded using RELREC.
13. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the TU
domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: --MODIFY, --POS, --BODSYS, -- ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.

6.3.12.2 Tumor/Lesion Results (TR)
TR – Description/Overview A findings domain that represents quantitative measurements and/or qualitative assessments of the tumors, lesions, or locations of interest identified in the Tumor/Lesion Identification (TU) domain. The TR domain represents quantitative measurements and/or qualitative assessments of the tumors, lesions, or locations of interest (e.g., tumors, cardiovascular culprit lesions, organs, bone marrow, other sites of disease such as lymph nodes) identified in the Tumor/Lesion Identification (TU) domain. These measurements or qualitative assessments may be recorded at baseline and then at each subsequent assessment to support response evaluations. A typical record in the TR domain contains the following information:
• a unique tumor/lesion/location of interest ID value
• test and result
• method used
• role of the individual making the assessment
• timing information
Clinically accepted evaluation criteria expect that a tumor/lesion/location of interest identified by the ID is the same tumor/lesion/location of interest at each subsequent assessment. The TR domain does not include anatomical location information on each measurement/assessment record, because this would duplicate information represented in TU. The multi-domain approach to representing oncology assessment data was developed largely to reduce duplication of stored information. TR – Specification tr.xpt, Tumor/Lesion Results — Findings. One record per tumor measurement/assessment per visit per subject per assessor, Tabulation.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. TR – Assumptions
1. TRLNKID is used to relate records in the TR domain to an identification record in TU domain. The organization of data across the TU and TR domains
requires a RELREC relationship to link the related data rows. A dataset-to-dataset link would be the most appropriate linking mechanism. Utilizing 1 of the existing ID variables is not possible, because --GRPID, --REFID, and --SPID may be used for other purposes, per the SDTM. The --LNKID variable is used for values that support a RELREC dataset-to-dataset relationship and to provide a unique code for each identified tumor/lesion/location of interest.
2. TRLNKGRP is used to relate records in the TR domain to a response assessment record in the RS domain. The organization of data across the TR and
RS domains requires a RELREC relationship to link the related data rows. A dataset-to-dataset link would be the most appropriate linking mechanism. Utilizing 1 of the existing ID variables is not possible because --GRPID, --REFID, and --SPID may be used for other purposes, per the SDTM. The -- LNKGRP variable is used for values that support a RELREC dataset-to-dataset relationship and to provide a unique code for each response and associated tumor/lesion measurements/assessments.
3. TRTESTCD/TRTEST values for this domain are published as Controlled Terminology. For some TRTESTCD/TRTEST values, CDISC CT includes
codelists for use with TRORRES. The associations between the test values and results are in the Oncology codetable, which, along with the Controlled Terminology Rules for Oncology, is available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology. The sponsor should not derive results for any test (e.g., percent change from nadir in sum of diameter) if the result was not collected. Tests would be included in the domain only if those data points have been collected on a CRF, presented by the CRF collection system, or supplied by an external assessor as part of an electronic data transfer. It is not intended that the sponsor would create derived records to supply those values in the TR domain. Derived records/results (outside the CRF) should be provided in the analysis dataset (ADaM).
4. In order to support data value standardization it is sometimes appropriate to standardize an original result value in TRORRES to a standardized result
value in TRSTRESC and TRSTRESN. For example, in the published RECIST criteria, a standardized value of 5 mm is used in the calculation to determine response when a tumor is “too small to measure." The original or collected value "TOO SMALL TO MEASURE" should be represented in the TRORRES variable and the standardized value should be represented in the TRSTRESC and TRSTRESN variables. The information should be represented on a single row of data showing the standardization between the original result, TRORRES, and the standard results, TRSTRESC/TRSTRESN, as follows:

| Variable<br>Name | Variable Label | Type | Controlled Terms, R<br>Codelist or Format1 | ole | CDISC Notes | Core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TRDY | Study Day of<br>Tumor/Lesion<br>Measurement | Num | T | iming | Study day of the scan/image/physical exam, measured as integer days. Algorithm for calculations | Perm |
|  |  |  |  |  | must be relative to the sponsor-defined RFSTDTC variable in Demographics. |  |

| T01 | DIAMETER | Diameter | TOO SMALL<br>TO MEASURE | mm | 5 | 5 | mm |


## Page 353

5. The acceptance flag variable (TRACPTFL) identifies those records that have been determined to be the accepted assessments/measurements by an
independent assessor. This flag would be provided by an independent assessor and when multiple assessors (e.g., "RADIOLOGIST 1", "RADIOLOGIST 2", "ADJUDICATOR") provide assessments or evaluations at the same time point or an overall evaluation. This flag should not be used by a sponsor for any other purpose. It is not expected that the TRACPTFL flag would be populated by the sponsor; instead, that type of record selection should be handled in the analysis dataset (ADaM).
6. The evaluator-specified variable (TREVALID) is used in conjunction with TREVAL to provide additional detail of who is providing measurements or
assessments (e.g., TREVAL = "INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR", TREVALID = "RADIOLOGIST 1"). The TREVALID variable is subject to controlled terminology. Note: TREVAL must also be populated when TREVALID is populated.
7. When additional data are collected about a procedure (e.g., imaging procedure) from which tumor/lesion results are determined, the data about the
procedure is stored in the PR domain and the link between the tumor/lesion results and the procedure should be recorded using RELREC.
8. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the TR domain, but the following qualifiers would
not generally be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPEC, -- SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV.
6.3.12.3 Tumor Identification/Tumor Results Examples
Example 1 This is an example of using the TU domain to represent non-cancerous lesions identified in the heart. Subject 40913 had a peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) procedure on February 1, 2007. A target lesion (L01) was identified in the infrarenal aorta within the aorto-iliac vessel (L01-1). During the same PVI procedure, the subject also had a target graft lesion (L01-G) identified in the left femoro-popliteal graft (L01- G1). The lesion location was noted within the graft anastomosis proximal, the type was a synthetic graft composed of Gore-Tex, and the anastomosis was in the left popliteal artery. Rows 1-2: Show the target lesion located in the infrarenal aorta and within the aorta-iliac vessel. Row 3: Shows the PVI target limb in which the graft lesion is located identified by the investigator. Rows 4-5: Show the target graft lesion located in the left femoro-popliteal graft and within the femoro-popliteal vessel. tu.xpt

Example 2 This is an example of tumors identified and tracked using RECIST 1.1 criteria. TU shows the target and non-target tumors identified by an investigator at a screening visit and also shows that the investigator determined at the week 6 visit that 1 of the previously identified tumors had split. Rows 1-6: Show for subject 44444 the target and non-target tumors identified by the investigator at the screening visit. Rows 7-8: Show the investigator determined that a tumor (TULNKID = "T04" at screening) had split into 2 separate tumors at the week 6 visit. The 2 distinct pieces of the original tumor were then tracked independently from that point in the study forward. tu.xpt

TR shows measurements (i.e., short axis) of lymph nodes as well as measurements of other non-lymph node target tumors (i.e., longest diameter). In this example, when TRTEST = "Tumor State" and TRORRES = "ABSENT", it indicates that the target lymph node lesion was no longer pathological (i.e., diameter reduced below 10mm). The overall assessment of lymph nodes is represented with TRTEST = "Lymph Nodes State". A lymph node state of "NON-PATHOLOGICAL" means that all target lymph node lesions have a short axis less than 10mm. A lymph node state of "PATHOLOGICAL" means that at least 1 target lymph node lesion has a short axis greater than or equal to 10mm. Rows 1-8: Show the measurements of the target tumors and other assessments of the target and non-target tumors at the screening visit. Rows 9-21: Show the measurements of the target tumors and other assessments of the target and non-target tumors at the week 6 visit. Rows 22-27: Show the measurements of the target tumors and other assessments of the target and non-target tumors at the week 12 visit.

1In this column, an asterisk (*) indicates that the variable may be subject to controlled terminology. CDISC/NCI codelist values are enclosed in parentheses. VS – Assumptions
1. In cases where the LOINC dictionary is used for vital sign tests, the permissible variable VSLOINC may be used. Sponsors are expected to provide the dictionary name and version used to map terms using
the external codelist element in the Define-XML document.
2. If a reference range is available for a vital signs test, the variables VSORNRLO, VSORNRHI, VSNRIND from the Findings observation class may be added to the domain. VSORNRLO and VSORNRHI
would represent the reference range, and VSNRIND would be used to indicate where a result falls with respect to the reference range (e.g., "HIGH", "LOW"). If toxicity grading is available, values would be represented in the variables VSTOX and VSTOXGR. Clinical significance would be represented in VSCLSIG, as described in Section 4.5.5, Clinical Significance for Findings Observation Class Data.
3. Associations between some vital sign tests and qualifier codelists are described in the VS codetable, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.
4. Any Identifiers, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the VS domain, but the following qualifiers would not generally be used: --BODSYS, --XFN, --SPEC, --
SPCCND, --FAST. VS – Examples Example 1 This example shows results for 1 subject from 2 visits (i.e., baseline, visit 2). Rows 1-4, 6-7: VSTPT and VSTPTNUM are populated because more than 1 measurement was taken at this visit. Rows 2, 4-5, 7-9: VSLOBXFL="Y" indicates that the observation was used as the last observation before exposure measurement. Rows 10-11: Show blood pressure observations obtained at visit 2. Row 12: Shows a value collected in one unit, but converted to selected standard unit. Row 13: Shows the proper use of the --STAT variable to indicate "NOT DONE" where a reason was collected when a test was not done. vs.xpt

6.4 Findings About Events or Interventions
Findings About Events or Interventions is a specialization of the Findings general observation class. As such, it shares all qualities and conventions of Findings observations but is specialized by the addition of the -- OBJ variable.
6.4.1 When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions
The Findings About Events or Interventions structure (or "FA structure") is intended, as its name implies, to be used when collected data represent ”findings about” an event or intervention that cannot be represented within an event or intervention record or as a supplemental qualifier to such a record. Not all findings associated with an event or intervention should be represented in the FA structure. The following are criteria for using the FA structure. Criterion 1: Data or observations that have different timing from an associated event or intervention as a whole Per Section 6.2.1, Adverse Events, assumption 7.e, "It is the sponsor's responsibility to define an event." One common practice is to define an event as the period of time during which an adverse event has a constant severity (or, sometimes, other properties). In this approach, a single medical condition may be represented by multiple AE records (see AE Example 4), each with a start and end date, and FA records with a test of severity would not be applicable. Another common practice is to define an adverse event as the whole of a medical condition, even if severity (and other properties) change over time. With this approach, FA records may be used to represent data about severity (or other properties) of the adverse event that have timing different from the medical condition as a whole. A finding that is about part of an event, rather than the event as a whole, meets this criterion for the use of FA. An assessment of an event that is not about the whole of an event may be a "snapshot," an assessment at a point in time, or a "slice," an assessment over a period of time (i.e., evaluation interval) during the event. In Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions, Example 1 shows snapshot assessments at 3 points in time. The timing variables used to represent a snapshot assessment generally include FADTC, along with visit and time point variables as applicable, but not FAEVLINT or FAEVINTX. FA Example 5 shows assessments over 24-hour slices of the event. Slice assessments use an evaluation interval, so the timing variables used would generally include FADTC and either FAEVLINT or FAEVINTX. Repeated assessments of disease or treatment-related symptoms, particularly symptoms that are likely to be intermittent, generally produce results that apply to only part of an event; these are represented as findings about clinical events. For example, if severity of an AE is collected at scheduled time points (e.g., per visit) throughout the duration of the AE, as in Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions, Example 6, the severities have timing that are different from that of the AE as a whole. Instead, the collected severities represent snapshots or slices of the AE over time. Occasionally, data collection will include questions about the occurrence of prespecified events which are of naturally short duration, so that even though the assessments are repeated during the study, each assessment will provide information about an event as a whole. These type of assessments can be represented in the Events domain.

A finding which is a summary of multiple occurrences of a particular kind of event meets this criterion. For example, the number of episodes of vomiting during a particular time period is a finding about vomiting. For events that have not ended at the time of an assessment, "event as a whole" means the event up to the time of the assessment. An event need not have ended for information about the event to be considered information about the event as a whole. Data about medical conditions collected before start of study treatment are usually about the event as a whole and are usually represented in Medical History (MH). See Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions, Example 3. Assessments of parts of events (snapshots or slices) are represented in FA and may or may not have parent records (e.g., FA Example 5). If the FA dataset is split by parent domain, the sponsor must decide which Events domain would have held a parent record for a parent-less FA record. A sponsor may consider that symptoms of the disease under study would be considered clinical events represented in the CE domain, so that FA records for symptoms of the disease under study would be in the FACE split of the FA domain. This criterion is less likely to apply to interventions records than to events records. Interventions records often represent a series of individual substance administrations. When there is a change in dosing or other characteristics during the series, the most appropriate solution may be to represent the series of individual administrations in 2 records, one for the administrations before the change and a second for administrations after the change, rather than to create findings about records. Criterion 2: An observation about an event or intervention which requires more than 1 variable for its representation, particularly when the observation may be represented with Findings class variables (e.g., units, method) The need to represent data which require more than 1 variable in a findings about structure, rather than by adding 2 or more supplemental qualifiers to an Events or Interventions domain, is driven by the fact that each supplemental qualifier is in a separate record that links only to the parent record. For example, if the size of a rash is measured, then the result and measurement unit (e.g., centimeters, inches) can be represented in an FA domain in a single record; other information regarding the rash (e.g., start and end times) would, if collected, appear in an Event record. See, for example, the longest diameter measurements in Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions, Example 2. Criterion 3: Data or information that indicate the occurrence of pre-specified AEs Every record in the AE domain must represent an event that actually occurred. Therefore, AE probing questions that are answered in the negative (e.g., did not occur, unknown, not done) cannot be stored in the AE domain. All answers to probing questions about the occurrence of pre-specified adverse events can be stored in the FA domain. (See Section 6.4.4., Findings About Events or Interventions, Example 4.) For each "Y" response to a probing question there should be a record in the AE domain. The FA record and the AE record may be linked via RELREC. The responses to all AE occurrence questions—whether "Y", "N", or "NOT DONE"—are represented in FAAE. This approach supports summarization of incidence directly from the FA dataset. Previous versions of the SDTMIG included the criterion, "Data or observations about an Event or Intervention for which no Event or Intervention record has been collected or created." This criterion has been removed, because the amount of data collected about an event or intervention should not determine whether data are represented in an FA dataset. Data that can be represented in an event or intervention record, particularly data for which standard variables exist, should be represented in the appropriate Event or Intervention domain, even if the record is sparse. The absence of a "parent" event or intervention record does not prevent representing data about an event or intervention in an FA dataset. One situation that previously used this criterion was the collection of a diagnosis date or symptom onset date for the disease under study when the occurrence of the disease was collected in an inclusion criterion, rather than as medical history. That situation can now be represented in an MH record that includes MHEVDTYP. Events identified during a physical examination would, in accordance with CDASH best practices, be recorded in medical history or adverse events CRFs. Previous versions of the SDTMIG included the criterion, "Data or information about an Event or Intervention that indicate the occurrence of related symptoms or therapies." This criterion has been removed because information about related symptoms or therapies is more appropriately represented as information about those symptoms or therapies rather than as information about the event or intervention to which they are thought be related. Data about related symptoms or interventions should be evaluated against the above Criterion 1 - 3 to determine whether they should be represented in an FA dataset. If data do not meet one of the criteria above, they should be represented in


## Page 363

an event or interventions record. If data do meet criteria to be represented in the findings about structure, FAOBJ will be the name of the symptom. The relationship to the disease under study may be represented in FACAT or FASCAT, as in FA Example 5. The term "symptom" is often used loosely to refer to both symptoms (reported by the subject) and signs (observable by others). When data about signs is collected via questions about the subject's past experience, signs are appropriately represented as SDTM events. However, when a sign is identified or assessed during an examination at a point in time, it may be more appropriate to represent it as an SDTM finding. Points to Consider The choice between representing a data item as a supplemental qualifier or as a finding about an event or intervention may not be clear-cut. The following questions may help in making a decision.
• Does the data item have its own timing, separate from the timing of the event or intervention? If the data
item represents some action during or after the event or intervention, it may be considered to have its own timing, and meet Criterion 1.
o If the event or intervention is a disease milestone, then RELMIDS is not included in this event or
intervention record. Is the relationship of a data item to the disease milestone (RELMIDS) needed? If so, it can be represented in FA, but not as a supplemental qualifier to the parent record.
• Are there several items which would be clearer if they could be grouped together? If so, the FA structure
allows the use of FAGRPID, FACAT, or FASCAT to group the items.
• Is the data item alone in a particular study, but related to other data items likely to be collected in other
studies? If so, it may be preferable to represent the item in FA, where other FA variables might be needed for related items in the future. For example, the response to "Was a rechallenge conducted?" might be represented as a supplemental qualifier, but if additional information about the rechallenge (e.g, When?, What was the result?) were collected, then the FA structure would be needed.
• Are there multiple evaluators for a data item that could otherwise be represented as a supplemental
qualifier? If so, FA may provided a clearer representation of the multiple opinions, and would also allow the use of FAEVALID.
6.4.2 Naming Findings About Domains
Findings About domains are defined to store findings about events or interventions. Sponsors may choose to represent FA data collected in the study in a single FA dataset (potentially splitting the FA domain into physically separate datasets following the guidance described in Section 4.1.6, Additional Guidance on Dataset Naming), or separate datasets, assigning unique custom 2-character domain codes (see examples in Section 6.4.5, Skin Response). For example, if findings about clinical events and findings about medical history are collected in a study, these could be represented as:
1. A single FA domain, perhaps separated with different FACAT and/or FASCAT values
2. A split FA domain following the guidance in Section 4.1.7, Splitting Domains:
o The DOMAIN value would be “FA”.
o Variables that require a prefix would use “FA”.
o The dataset names would be the domain name plus up to 2 additional characters indicating the parent
domain (e.g., FACE for Findings About Clinical Events, FAMH for Findings About Medical History). This naming convention may be used for an FA domain that has a parent domain even when the study has only 1 FA dataset that is not being split.
o FASEQ must be unique within USUBJID for all records across the split datasets.
o Supplemental qualifier datasets would need to be managed at the split-file level (e.g.,
suppface.xpt, suppfamh.xpt). Within each supplemental qualifier dataset, RDOMAIN would be "FA".


## Page 364

o If a dataset-level RELREC is defined (e.g., between the CE and FACE datasets), then RDOMAIN may
contain up to 4 characters to effectively describe the relationship between the CE parent records and the FACE child records.
3. Separate domains where:
o The DOMAIN value is sponsor-defined and does not begin with FA, following examples in Section
6.4.5, Skin Response, which has a domain code of SR.
o All published FA guidance applies, specifically:
▪ The --OBJ variable cannot be added to a standard Findings domain. A domain is either a Findings domain or a Findings About domain, not one or the other depending on the situation. ▪ When the --OBJ variable is included in a domain, this identifies it as an FA domain, and the --OBJ variable must be populated for all records.
o All published domain guidance applies, specifically:
▪ Variables that require a prefix would use the 2-character domain code chosen. For the naming of datasets with findings about events or interventions for associated persons, refer to the SDTMIG: Associated Persons (available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm).
6.4.3 Variables Unique to Findings About
The variable --OBJ is unique to Findings About. In conjunction with FATESTCD, it describes what the topic of the observation is; therefore, both are required to be populated for every record. FATESTCD describes the measurement/evaluation and FAOBJ describes the event or intervention that the measurement/evaluation is about. When collected data fit a qualifier variable (see SDTM Sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3) and are represented in the FA domain, the name of the variable should be used as the value of FATESTCD. For example,

The use of the same names (e.g., SEV, OCCUR) for both qualifier variables in the observation classes and FATESTCD is deliberate, but should not lead users to conclude that the collection of such data (e.g., severity/intensity, occurrence) must be stored in the FA domain. In fact, data should only be stored in the FA domain if they do not fit in the general observation-class domain. If the data describe the underlying event or intervention as a whole and share its timing, then the data should be stored as a qualifier of the general observationclass record. A record in FA may or may not have a parent record in an events or interventions domain. If an FA record does have a parent record, the value in FAOBJ should match the value in --TERM or --TRT, unless the parent domain is dictionary coded or subject to controlled terminology, in which case FAOBJ should match the value in --DECOD. Examples for the FA and Skin Response (SR) domains include the use of RELREC to represent the relationship between an FA domain and a parent domain.

1. The Findings About domain shares all qualities and conventions of findings observations.
2. See Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions; and Section 8.6.3, Guidelines for Differentiating Between Interventions,
Events, Findings, and Findings About Events or Interventions; for guidance on deciding between the use of the FA domain and other SDTM structures.
3. See Section 6.4.2, Naming Findings About Domains, for advice on splitting the FA domain.
4. Some variables in the events and interventions domains (e.g., OCCUR, SEV, TOXGR) represent findings about the whole of the event or intervention.
When FA is used to represent findings about a part of the event or intervention (i.e., the assessment has different timing from the event as a whole), the FATEST and FATESTCD values should be the same as the variable name and variable label in the corresponding event or intervention domain. See Section 6.4.3, Variables Unique to Findings About. a. Associations between some findings about cardiovascular interventions or events and their response codelists are described in the CV codetable, available at https://www.cdisc.org/standards/terminology/controlled-terminology.

5. When data collection establishes a relationship between FA records and an events or interventions record, the relationship should be represented in
RELREC. a. The FAOBJ variable alone is not sufficient to establish a relationship, because an events or interventions dataset may have multiple records for the same topic (e.g., --TERM or --DECOD, --TRT or --DECOD).
6. Any Identifier variables, Timing variables, or Findings general observation-class qualifiers may be added to the FA domain, but the following qualifiers
should generally not be used: --BODSYS, --MODIFY, --SEV, --TOXGR. FA – Examples Example 1 The following example CRF collects severity and symptoms data at multiple time points about a migraine event, relative to dosing. Migraine Symptoms Diary Migraine Reference Number xx When did the migraine start? DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM When was study treatment taken? DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM Answer the following 5 minutes BEFORE dosing Severity of migraine ○ Mild ○ Moderate ○ Severe Associated symptoms: Sensitivity to light ○ No ○ Yes Sensitivity to sound ○ No ○ Yes Nausea ○ No ○ Yes Aura ○ No ○ Yes Answer the following 30 minutes AFTER dosing Severity of migraine ○ Mild ○ Moderate ○ Severe Associated symptoms: Sensitivity to light ○ No ○ Yes Sensitivity to sound ○ No ○ Yes Nausea ○ No ○ Yes Aura ○ No ○ Yes Answer the following 90 minutes AFTER dosing Severity of migraine ○ Mild ○ Moderate ○ Severe Associated symptoms: Sensitivity to light ○ No ○ Yes Sensitivity to sound ○ No ○ Yes Nausea ○ No ○ Yes Aura ○ No ○ Yes

In this example trial, migraines and symptoms associated with migraines were considered clinical events rather than reportable adverse events.

The remaining data on the CRF were "snapshots" taken at 3 time points; in accordance with Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions, criterion 1, these were represented as findings about events. The FACAT value "MIGRAINE SYMPTOMS" was used to represent the fact that these data were collected in a CRF module called "Migraine Symptoms Diary." Rows 1, 6, 11: Severity of the migraine was represented with FATESTCD="SEV". This FATESTCD value is derived from the events class variable name --SEV, and represents the same assessment as CESEV, except that this assessment is at a point in time rather than for the event as a whole. Rows 2-5, 7-10, 12-15: The presence of symptoms associated with migraine was represented with the name of the symptom in FAOBJ, as the data collected is about the occurrence of a particular symptom. The test code value "OCCUR" is derived from the events class variable name -- OCCUR, but is an assessment at a point in time, rather than about the event as a whole. The relationship of these symptoms to migraine is represented in FACAT, which indicates that these data were collected in the Migraine Symptoms Diary. face.xpt

Additional data about the rash were collected at visits 3 and 4, which occurred 2 days and 9 days after the start of the rash. These data were represented in an FA dataset because they were not about the event as a whole (see Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions, criterion 1). In addition, the measurement of the rash requires multiple variables (value and unit) for its representation and the numbers of various kinds of lesions within the rash are a set of similar assessments of the event (see Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions, criterion 2). faae.xpt

Example 3 This CRF collects information about rheumatoid arthritis. In this scenario, rheumatoid arthritis is a prerequisite for participation in an osteoporosis trial and was not collected as a Medical History (MH) event.

In this study, data were collected only at baseline. Because the occurrence and severity apply to the symptoms as a whole, they are represented in the MH domain. Note that the average duration of early morning stiffness cannot be represented in MHDUR because MHDUR would be the duration of the entire event, rather than the average of daily durations. Row 1: Because the CRF specifically collected date of diagnosis for rheumatoid arthritis, MHEVDTYP is populated with DIAGNOSIS to indicate that the date in MHSTDTC is the date of diagnosis. Rows 2-6: No start or end dates were collected for the symptoms, so the variable MHEVDTYP is not relevant for those records. MHEVDTYP is used only to specify the aspect of the event used to determine start and/or end dates. mh.xpt

Example 4 In this example, the occurrence of prespecified adverse events was solicited at every visit and the visit date was used as the date of collection. The data collected meet criterion 3 in Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions; that is, data that indicate the occurrence of prespecified AEs. Prespecified Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Date of assessment DD-MMM-YYYY Did the following occur? If Yes, enter a complete record in the AE CRF Headache ○ No ○ Yes ○ Not Done Respiratory infection ○ No ○ Yes ○ Not Done Nausea ○ No ○ Yes ○ Not Done This example shows data for 1 subject at 2 visits. Each response (e.g., No, Yes) to the prespecified terms is represented in the FA domain. The visit date was used to populated FADTC. Rows 1, 4: "Headache" was reported at both visits. Rows 2, 5: "Respiratory infection" was not present at either visit. Row 3: The investigator did not ask the subject about the occurrence of nausea. This was represented by FASTAT="NOT DONE". Row 6: "Nausea" was reported at visit 3. faae.xpt

For each prespecified adverse event for which FAORRES = "Y", the adverse event has a record in the AE domain with AEPRESP = "Y". No relationship was collected to link the FAAE record for the occurrence indicator test with the AE entries, so no RELREC was created. Note that not all AE expected variables are included in the following example. Row 1: Comparison of this AE record with the FA dataset records for "Headache" shows that there are 2 records with FAOBJ="Headache". FAORRES="Y" indicates that this AE record is associated with both FA records, because this headache started before visit 2 and ended between visits 2 and 3. Row 2: Comparison of this AE record with the FA dataset shows that this AE started and ended in the time between visits 2 and 3, and is consistent with the FA response for FAOBJ="Nausea" for visit 3.

Example 5 In this example, data about prespecified symptoms of the disease under study were collected on a daily basis. Although the date of the assessment was captured in the CRF header (not shown), start and end timing of the prespecified symptoms was not.

The collected data were represented in FA because they meet criterion 1 in Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions, that is, data that do not describe an event or intervention as a whole. In this study, GERD symptoms were considered clinical events. In addition, the volume of vomit data met criterion 2 data (“about” an event or intervention), having qualifiers that can be represented in Findings variables (e.g., units, method). This SDTM example represents data from 2 visits for 1 subject. FAEVINTX indicates that assessments were for the previous 24 hours. Rows 1-4: Show the results for the vomiting tests at visit 1. Because the number of episodes was recorded as ">10", this is represented in FASTRESC but not in FASTRESN. Rows 5-7: Show the results for the diarrhea tests at visit 1. Rows 8-10: Show the results for the nausea tests at visit 1. Row 11: Shows that vomiting did not occur in the 24 hours before visit 2; thus, volume, number of episodes, and severity were not applicable. Rows 12-14: Show the results for the diarrhea tests at visit 2. Row 15: Indicates that the occurrence of nausea was not assessed at visit 2. face.xpt

Example 6 In this example, the sponsor's definition of "event" meant that 1 record would be created for each adverse event, covering it from start to finish (see Section 6.2.1, Adverse Events, assumption 6.4).

An electronic data collection instrument would probably be constructed as 2 related modules:
• A module for the adverse event, where a record would be entered for each event
AE ID Adverse Event Start Date End Date
• A module for the severity assessment, where a record would be entered for each assessment
Visit AE ID Maximum severity since last visit ○ Mild ○ Moderate ○ Severe

|  |  |  |  | At each visit, record the maximum severity of the adverse event since the last visit. |  |  |  |  |

AE collection started after visit 1, so the first severity data was collected at visit 2. The collected data met criterion 1 in Section 6.4.1, When to Use Findings About Events or Interventions, for data that do not describe an event or intervention as a whole. In this example, the sponsor populated AESEV with the maximum severity over the course of the event. This was not directly collected, but rather determined from the weekly maximum severity assessments collected on the CRF. For clarity, only selected variables in the AE dataset are shown here. ae.xpt

The values in FAOBJ are the values from AEDECOD, which were assigned during coding, rather than directly collected. The values in FASPID are the AE identifiers from AESPID. FAEVINTX indicates that the evaluation was for the period since the last visit. Rows 1-4: Show severity data collected at the 4 visits that occurred between the start and end of the AE “Morning queasiness”. FAOBJ=NAUSEA, which is the value of AEDECOD in the associated AE record. Rows 5-6: Show severity data collected at the 2 visits that occurred between the start and end of the AE “Watery stools.” FAOBJ=DIARRHEA, which is the value of AEDECOD in the associated AE record. faae.xpt

Because the AE identifier (AESPID) was included in the FA dataset, AE and FA data can be related with a dataset-to-dataset relationship. relrec.xpt

1. The Skin Response (SR) domain is used to represent findings about an intervention, but it has its own domain code, SR, rather than the domain code
FA.
2. This domain is intended specifically for tests of the immune response to substances that are intended to provoke such a response (e.g., allergens used in
allergy testing). SR is not intended for other injection-site reactions, including reactogencity events that may follow a vaccine administration.

3. Because a subject is typically exposed to many test materials at the same time, SROBJ is needed to represent the test material for each response record.
The method of assessment could be a skin-prick test, a skin-scratch test, or other method of introducing the challenge substance into the skin.
4. Any Identifier variables, Timing variables, or Findings general observation class qualifiers may be added to the SR domain, but the following qualifiers
would not generally be used: --POS, --BODSYS, --ORNRLO, --ORNRHI, --STNRLO, --STNRHI, --STNRC, --NRIND, --RESCAT, --XFN, --LOINC, --SPCCND, --FAST, --TOX, --TOXGR, --SEV. SR – Examples Example 1 In this example, the subject is dosed with increasing concentrations of Johnson grass IgE. Rows 1-4: Show responses associated with the administration of a histamine control. Rows 5-8: Show responses associated with the administration of Johnson grass IgE. These records describe the dose response to different concentrations of Johnson grass IgE antigen, as reflected in SROBJ. All rows show a specific location on the back (e.g., SITE1), represented in FOCID. sr.xpt

Example 2 In this example, the study product dose, Dog Epi IgG, was administered at increasing concentrations. The size of the wheal is being measured (reaction to Dog Epi IgG ) to evaluate the efficacy of the Dog Epi IgG extract versus a negative control (NC) and a positive control (PC) in the testing of allergenic extracts. While SROBJ is populated with information about the substance administered, full details regarding the study product would be submitted in the Exposure (EX) dataset. The relationship between SR records and EX records would be represented using RELREC. Rows 1-6: Show the response (description and reaction grade) to the study product at a series of different dose levels, the latter reflected in SROBJ. The descriptions of SRORRES values are correlated to a grade, and the grade values are stored in SRSTRESC.

Example 3 This example shows the results from a tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test administered using the Mantoux technique. The subject was given an intradermal injection of standard tuberculin PPD (i.e., PPD-S) in the left forearm at visit 1; see the Procedure Agents (AG) record below. At visit 2, the induration diameter and presence of blistering were recorded. Because the tuberculin PPD skin test cannot be interpreted using the induration diameter and blistering alone (e.g., risk for being infected with TB must also be considered), the interpretation of the skin test resides in its own row. The time point variables show that the planned time for reading the test was 48 hours after Mantoux administration. However, a comparison of datetime values in SRDTC and SRRFTDTC shows that in this case the test was read at 53 hours and
56 minutes after Mantoux administration.
Row 1: Shows the longest diameter in millimeters of the induration after receiving an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL containing 5TU of PPD-S in the left forearm. Row 2: Shows the presence of blistering at the tuberculin PPD skin test site. Row 3: Shows the interpretation of the tuberculin PPD skin test. SRGRPID is used to tie together the results to the interpretation. sr.xpt
